# nesy-intensional-semantics
 
This repository contains work on an intensional semantics for a fragment of first order logic, where the intensions of predicates are defined through the prompt engineering of large language models, with the objective of allowing intensional knowledge expressed in natural language to be used to assert and validate extensional knowledge represented in databases and knowledge graphs.
