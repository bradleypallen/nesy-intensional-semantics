The station was opened along with the first stage and is currently the second-deepest station in the world at 105.5 metres (346 ft), after Hongyancun station of the Chongqing Metro. The depth is attributed to the geography of Kyiv, whose high bank of the Dnipro River rises above the rest of the city. Also unusual is the station's design, which lacks a central concourse and thus is similar in layout to stations of the London Underground.\nSince 1986, the station has the status of \"Architectural Monument of Local Significance\", Protection Number 187. Dnipro: Dnipro is Ukraine's fourth-largest city, with about one million inhabitants. It is located in the eastern part of Ukraine, 391 km (243 mi) southeast of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on the Dnipro River, after which its name is derived. Dnipro is the administrative centre of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. It hosts the administration of Dnipro urban hromada. Dnipro has a population of 968,502 (2022 estimate).\nArcheological evidence suggests the site of the present city was settled by Cossack communities from at least 1524. Yekaterinoslav (\"glory of Catherine\") was established by decree of the Russian Empress Catherine the Great in 1787 as the administrative center of Novorossiya. From the end of the 19th century, the town attracted foreign capital and an international, multi-ethnic workforce exploiting Kryvbas iron ore and Donbas coal.\nRenamed Dnipropetrovsk in 1926 after the Ukrainian Communist Party leader Grigory Petrovsky, it became a focus for the Stalinist commitment to the rapid development of heavy industry. After World War II, this included nuclear, arms, and space industries whose strategic importance led to Dnipropetrovsk's designation as a closed city.\nFollowing the Euromaidan events of 2014, the city politically shifted away from pro-Russian parties and figures towards those favoring closer ties with the European Union. As a result of decommunization, the city was renamed Dnipro in 2016. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Dnipro rapidly developed as a logistical hub for humanitarian aid and a reception point for people fleeing the various battle fronts.\n\n", "actual": "1", "rationale": "Arsenalna and Dnipro are both stations on the Kyiv Metro's Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line, and they are adjacent to each other.", "predicted": "1"}, {"predicate": "adjacent station", "arguments": "Dordrecht railway station, Dordrecht Stadspolders railway station", "world": "adjacent station: the stations next to this station, sharing the same line(s).

Scarborough Londesborough Road railway station: Scarborough Londesborough Road railway station, originally called Washbeck Excursion Station, was built as an excursion station to ease operating pressure at Scarborough Central in the holiday resort of Scarborough. It had a through and a bay platform. Excursion trains from all over the country could be routed into it rather than the main Central station to disembark their passengers before heading onwards to the Whitby branch line to be stabled in carriage sidings at Northstead/Gallows Close on the town's northern outskirts. Return services would follow the same route in the opposite direction to load up before departure.\nIt was opened on 8 June 1908 by the North Eastern Railway, but it was not advertised in public timetables until 1933, after it had been upgraded to a public station. It had one through platform which could handle a 14-carriage train, and a south-facing end platform which could handle 11-carriage trains. It was closed to passenger trains by British Railways on 25 August 1963, but remained in use for stabling coaching stock until its official closure on 4 July 1966.\nThe station building and the remains of the 14 coach long platform can still be seen from trains on the Yorkshire Coast Line and on the York to Scarborough section of the North TransPennine route on the west side of the tracks approaching Scarborough. However, most of the platform has been demolished due to the construction of a new service depot for TransPennine Express trains.
