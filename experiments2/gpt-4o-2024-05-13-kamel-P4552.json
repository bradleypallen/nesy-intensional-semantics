Dome Peak: Dome Peak is a high, massive, glaciated mountain in the Glacier Peak Wilderness of Washington's North Cascades. The remote location of Dome Peak, combined with its height, make it a less common destination for Cascade Range mountaineers. Dome Peak is at the southern end of the Ptarmigan Traverse mountaineering route. It is located at the extreme southeast corner of Skagit County. The mountain was given its name by Albert H. Sylvester, the first forest supervisor of Wenatchee National Forest.\nThere are two main summits connected by a narrow ridge with the northeastern summit being higher than the southwestern. Chickamin Glacier is north of the peak while Dome Glacier is to the west. A rock face drops off to the southeast. Dana Glacier is on the north side of a ridge that connects Dome Peak and Spire Point.\nThe higher northeast peak was first climbed by George Freed and Eric Larson on August 1, 1936.  The southwest peak was first climbed on July 5, 1936, by Forest Farr, Norval Grigg, and Don Blair. Cascade Range: The Cascade Range or Cascades is a major mountain range of western North America, extending from southern British Columbia through Washington and Oregon to Northern California. It includes both non-volcanic mountains, such as many of those in the North Cascades, and the notable volcanoes known as the High Cascades. The small part of the range in British Columbia is referred to as the Canadian Cascades or, locally, as the Cascade Mountains. The highest peak in the range is Mount Rainier in Washington at 14,411 feet (4,392 m).\nThe Cascades are part of the Pacific Ocean's Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Ocean. All of the eruptions in the contiguous United States over the last 200 years have been from Cascade volcanoes. The two most recent were Lassen Peak from 1914 to 1921 and a major eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. Minor eruptions of Mount St. Helens have also occurred since, most recently from 2004 to 2008. The Cascade Range is a part of the American Cordillera, a nearly continuous chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that form the western \"backbone\" of North, Central, and South America.\nThe Cascades are home to many national parks and protected areas, including North Cascades National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, Crater Lake National Park, and Lassen Volcanic National Park.

Pirin is noted for its rich flora and fauna, as well as for the presence of a number of relict species. Much of the area is forested, with some of the best preserved conifer woods in Bulgaria, holding important populations of the Balkan endemic species Macedonian pine, Bosnian pine and Bulgarian fir. Animals include many species of high conservation value, such as brown bear, gray wolf, wildcat, European pine marten, wild boar, red deer, roe deer, chamois, etc.\nThe combination of favourable natural conditions and varied historical heritage contribute makes Pirin an important tourist destination.

This contributes to the characteristic haze on the mountains and their perceived color.\nWithin the Blue Ridge province are two major national parks: the Shenandoah National Park in the northern section and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the southern section. The Blue Ridge Parkway, a 469-mile (755 km) long scenic highway, connects the two parks and runs along the ridge crest-lines, as does the Appalachian Trail.

Its nearest higher neighbor is Tahtlum Peak, 1.45 mi (2.33 km) to the east. The name Naches Peak was proposed by the Yakima Chamber of Commerce and approved by Asahel Curtis in 1927. The Naches Peak Loop Trail is a popular 3.5 mile trail encircling the peak. Precipitation runoff from the west side of Naches Peak drains into Chinook Creek, which is a tributary of the Ohanapecosh River, whereas the east side drains into tributaries of the American River. Cascade Range: The Cascade Range or Cascades is a major mountain range of western North America, extending from southern British Columbia through Washington and Oregon to Northern California. It includes both non-volcanic mountains, such as many of those in the North Cascades, and the notable volcanoes known as the High Cascades. The small part of the range in British Columbia is referred to as the Canadian Cascades or, locally, as the Cascade Mountains. The highest peak in the range is Mount Rainier in Washington at 14,411 feet (4,392 m).\nThe Cascades are part of the Pacific Ocean's Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Ocean.

The pass provides a route between the Kern River Valley and San Joaquin Valley on the west, and the Mojave Desert on the east.\nWalker Pass is a National Historic Landmark, and is under the stewardship of the Bureau of Land Management. Sierra Nevada: The Sierra Nevada ( see-ERR-\u0259 niv-A(H)D-\u0259) is a mountain range in the Western United States, between the Central Valley of California and the Great Basin. The vast majority of the range lies in the state of California, although the Carson Range spur lies primarily in Nevada. The Sierra Nevada is part of the American Cordillera, an almost continuous chain of mountain ranges that forms the western \"backbone\" of the Americas.\nThe Sierra runs 400 miles (640 km) north-south and its width ranges from 50 miles (80 km) to 80 miles (130 km) across east\u2013west. Notable features include General Sherman, the largest tree in the world by volume; Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney at 14,505 ft (4,421 m), the highest point in the contiguous United States; and Yosemite Valley sculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old granite, containing high waterfalls. The Sierra is home to three national parks, twenty-six wilderness areas, ten national forests, and two national monuments. These areas include Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks; and Devils Postpile National Monument.\nMore than one hundred million years ago during the Nevadan orogeny, granite formed deep underground. The range started to uplift less than five million years ago, and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range. The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada, which are reflected by the presence of five life zones (areas with similar plant and animal communities). Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces, creating spectacular fault block escarpments along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra.\nThe Sierra Nevada has played an important role in the history of California and the United States. The California Gold Rush occurred in the western foothills from 1848 through 1855.

The mountain is co-located in Madison and Page counties and is easily accessed from Skyline Drive by hiking trails. Along with Hawksbill Mountain (4,051 feet), it is only one of two peaks in the park higher than 4,000 feet.

This contributes to the characteristic haze on the mountains and their perceived color.\nWithin the Blue Ridge province are two major national parks: the Shenandoah National Park in the northern section and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the southern section. The Blue Ridge Parkway, a 469-mile (755 km) long scenic highway, connects the two parks and runs along the ridge crest-lines, as does the Appalachian Trail.

On the French side, to the north is the G\u00e9ant Glacier which overlooks the Mer de Glace. Mont Blanc massif: The Mont Blanc massif (French: Massif du Mont-Blanc; Italian: Massiccio del Monte Bianco) is a mountain range in the Alps, located mostly in France and Italy, but also straddling Switzerland at its northeastern end. It contains eleven major independent summits, each over 4,000 metres (13,123 ft) in height. It is named after Mont Blanc (4,808 metres (15,774 ft)), the highest point in western Europe and the European Union. Because of its considerable overall altitude, a large proportion of the massif is covered by glaciers, which include the Mer de Glace and the Miage Glacier \u2013 the longest glaciers in France and Italy, respectively.\nThe massif forms a watershed between the vast catchments of the rivers Rh\u00f4ne and Po, and a tripoint between France, Italy and Switzerland; it also marks the border between two climate regions by separating the northern and western Alps from the southern Alps. The mountains of the massif consist mostly of granite and gneiss rocks and at high altitudes the vegetation is an arctic-alpine flora.\nThe valleys that delimit the massif were used as communication routes by the Romans until they left around the 5th century AD. The region remained of some military importance through to the mid-20th century. A peasant farming economy operated within these valleys for many centuries until the glaciers and mountains were \"discovered\" by the outside world in the 18th century. Word of these impressive sights began to spread, and Mont Blanc was first climbed in 1786, marking the start of the sport of mountaineering. The region is now a major tourist destination, drawing in over six million visitors per year. It provides a wide range of opportunities for outdoor recreation and activities such as sight-seeing, hiking, rock climbing, mountaineering and skiing. Around one hundred people a year die across its mountains and, occasionally, bodies have been lost and entombed in its glaciers for decades.\nAccess into the mountains is facilitated by cable cars, mountain railways and mountain huts which offer overnight refuge to climbers and skiers. The long-distance Tour du Mont Blanc hiking trail circumnavigates the whole massif in an 11-day trek of 170 kilometres (110 mi). The Mont Blanc Tunnel connects the French town of Chamonix on the northern side with the Italian town of Courmayeur in the south. The high mountains have provided many opportunities for scientific research, including neutrino measurements within the tunnel and impact of climate change on its highest slopes.

Sierra Nevada: The Sierra Nevada ( see-ERR-\u0259 niv-A(H)D-\u0259) is a mountain range in the Western United States, between the Central Valley of California and the Great Basin. The vast majority of the range lies in the state of California, although the Carson Range spur lies primarily in Nevada. The Sierra Nevada is part of the American Cordillera, an almost continuous chain of mountain ranges that forms the western \"backbone\" of the Americas.\nThe Sierra runs 400 miles (640 km) north-south and its width ranges from 50 miles (80 km) to 80 miles (130 km) across east\u2013west. Notable features include General Sherman, the largest tree in the world by volume; Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney at 14,505 ft (4,421 m), the highest point in the contiguous United States; and Yosemite Valley sculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old granite, containing high waterfalls. The Sierra is home to three national parks, twenty-six wilderness areas, ten national forests, and two national monuments. These areas include Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks; and Devils Postpile National Monument.\nMore than one hundred million years ago during the Nevadan orogeny, granite formed deep underground. The range started to uplift less than five million years ago, and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range. The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada, which are reflected by the presence of five life zones (areas with similar plant and animal communities). Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces, creating spectacular fault block escarpments along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra.\nThe Sierra Nevada has played an important role in the history of California and the United States. The California Gold Rush occurred in the western foothills from 1848 through 1855.

The name of the massif probably comes from ris, the Croatian word for lynx. Another interpretation suggests that it comes from the local word risje, which is a name for a type of grass.\nThe vegetation is very diverse. Thirty different plant communities have been recorded, of which the most common are beech and fir forests (Fagetum illyricum abietotosum) which go up to 1240 m and then are replaced by sub-alpine beeches (Fagetum croaticum subalpinum). The highest vegetation is a belt of mountain pine (Pinetum mughi croaticum). The fauna is also diverse, but has been less well researched. There are particularly many species of birds and mammals, including several types of chamois, while since 1974 the area has once again been inhabited by the ris (lynx).\nThe highest peak of Risnjak mountain is \"Risnjak\" or Veliki Risnjak at 1528 m.a.s.l.

It rises to 373 metres (1,224 ft) above sea level and is mainly composed of sandstone, limestone and shale. A section of the Ulster Way formerly passed around the side of Benaughlin, within 300 m of the summit until it was revised in 2009 and now instead ascends from Florencecourt.\nThe hill was originally called Binn Eachlabhra, which is thought to mean \"peak of the speaking horse\". Locals would climb the hill on the last Sunday of July for the festival of Lughnasa, and folklore tells of a large white horse (An Chopail B\u00e1n) which would appear on the hill each year and speak to them. Benaughlin is also associated with Donn na Binne (\"Donn of the peak\"), the legendary ancestor of the Mag Uidhir (Maguire) chiefs of Fermanagh and a king of the S\u00ed. He is said to dwell in the mountain, and it was believed that whenever any of his real descendants die, a shard falls off its rocky face.\nBenaughlin is also known as Bin Mountain to local residents.\nThe blanket bog which covers Benaughlin was used as a source of fuel for the wealthy landowners in the area who lived in the nearby stately home of Florence Court. A path known as the Donkey Trail meanders up the side of the mountain; this was the route used for bringing the turf down off the mountain side. Cuilcagh: Cuilcagh (from Irish Binn Chuilceach, meaning 'chalky peak') is a mountain on the border between County Fermanagh (in Northern Ireland) and County Cavan (in the Republic of Ireland).

It is located in the Potos\u00ed Department, Sur L\u00edpez Province, San Pablo de L\u00edpez Municipality. Suri Phuyu lies within the borders of the Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve. It is situated southwest of the Uturunku volcano at the Challwiri salt flat, northeast of it. Andes: The Andes ( AN-deez), Andes Mountains or Andean Mountain Range (Spanish: Cordillera de los Andes; Quechua: Anti) are the longest continental mountain range in the world, forming a continuous highland along the western edge of South America. The range is 8,900 km (5,530 mi) long and 200 to 700 km (124 to 435 mi) wide (widest between 18\u00b0S and 20\u00b0S latitude) and has an average height of about 4,000 m (13,123 ft). The Andes extend from South to North through seven South American countries.:  Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador,  Colombia and western Venezuela.\nAlong their length, the Andes are split into several ranges, separated by intermediate depressions. The Andes are the location of several high plateaus\u2014some of which host major cities such as Quito, Bogot\u00e1, Cali, Arequipa, Medell\u00edn, Bucaramanga, Sucre, M\u00e9rida, El Alto and La Paz. The Altiplano Plateau is the world's second-highest after the Tibetan Plateau. These ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate: the Tropical Andes, the Dry Andes, and the Wet Andes.\nThe Andes Mountains are the highest mountain range outside Asia. The highest mountain outside Asia, Argentina's Aconcagua, rises to an elevation of about 6,961 m (22,838 ft) above sea level. The peak of Chimborazo in the Ecuadorian Andes is farther from the Earth's center than any other location on the Earth's surface, due to the equatorial bulge resulting from the Earth's rotation. The world's highest volcanoes are in the Andes, including Ojos del Salado on the Chile-Argentina border, which rises to 6,893 m (22,615 ft).\nThe Andes are also part of the American Cordillera, a chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western \"backbone\" of the Americas and Antarctica.", "actual": "1", "rationale": "To evaluate the truth value of the statement \"mountain range(Suri Phuyu, Andes)\" in the given hypothetical world, we need to determine if Suri Phuyu is part of the Andes mountain range.", "predicted": "1"}, {"predicate": "mountain range", "arguments": "Pforzheim, Black Forest", "world": "mountain range: range or subrange to which the geographical item belongs.

With an area of 97.8 square kilometres (37.8 sq mi), it is situated about halfway between the cities of Stuttgart and Karlsruhe at the confluence of three rivers (Enz, Nagold and W\u00fcrm). It marks the frontier between Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, being located on Baden territory. From 1535 to 1565, it was the home to the Margraves of Baden-Durlach.\nThe City of Pforzheim is a Stadtkreis, meaning it is both a municipality and a district at the same time. Also, it hosts the administrative offices of the Enz district that surrounds the city.\nDuring World War II, Pforzheim was bombed by the Allies a number of times. The largest raid, and one of the most devastating area bombardments of World War II, was carried out by the Royal Air Force (RAF) on the evening of 23 February 1945. Nearly one third of the town's population, 17,600 people, were killed in the air raid, and about 83% of the town's buildings were destroyed. The Allies believed that precision instruments were being produced here for use in the German war effort and that the town was a transport centre for the movement of German troops.\nFrom 1945 to 1948, Pforzheim (after the initial French occupation) was administered by the United States military and was part of the short-lived state of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden. In the 20 years following the end of the war, Pforzheim was gradually rebuilt. The town reflects the architecture of the postwar period and has some landmark buildings of the 1950s. Black Forest: The Black Forest (German: Schwarzwald [\u02c8\u0283va\u0281t\u0361svalt] ) is a large forested mountain range in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in southwest Germany, bounded by the Rhine Valley to the west and south and close to the borders with France and Switzerland. It is the source of the Danube and Neckar rivers.\nIts highest peak is the Feldberg with an elevation of 1,493 metres (4,898 ft) above sea level. Roughly oblong in shape, with a length of 160 kilometres (100 miles) and breadth of up to 50 km (30 mi), it has an area of about 6,009 km2 (2,320 sq mi).\nHistorically, the area was known for forestry and the mining of ore deposits, but tourism has now become the primary industry, accounting for around 300,000 jobs.

It can either be reached from Rannoch station or from Black Corries Lodge to the west. Grampian Mountains: The Grampian Mountains (Scottish Gaelic: Am Monadh) is one of the three major mountain ranges in Scotland, that together occupy about half of Scotland. The other two ranges are the Northwest Highlands and the Southern Uplands. The Grampian range extends southwest to northeast between the Highland Boundary Fault and the Great Glen. The range includes many of the highest mountains in the British Isles, including Ben Nevis (whose peak contains the highest point in the British Isles at 1,345 m or 4,413 ft above sea level) and Ben Macdui (whose peak contains second-highest at 1,309 m or 4,295 ft).\nA number of rivers and streams rise in the Grampians, including the Tay, Spey, Cowie Water, Burn of Muchalls, Burn of Pheppie, Burn of Elsick, Cairnie Burn, Don, Dee and Esk. The area is generally sparsely populated.\nThere is some ambiguity about the extent of the range, and until the nineteenth century, they were generally considered to be more than one range, which all formed part of the wider Scottish Highlands. This view is still held by many today, and they have no single name in the Scottish Gaelic language or the Doric dialect of Lowland Scots. In both languages, a number of names are used.

It is a between 2300 and 2700 m high plateau surrounded by massive escarpments. \nThe mountain is noted for its rock art and for its panoramic views of the Atlas range.  There are over thousand engraved images on the rocks dating back to 500 - 1000 BC. High Atlas: The High Atlas, also called the Grand Atlas, is a mountain range in central Morocco, North Africa, the highest part of the Atlas Mountains.\nThe High Atlas rises in the west at the Atlantic Ocean and stretches in an eastern direction to the Moroccan-Algerian border. At the Atlantic and to the southwest the range drops abruptly and makes an impressive transition to the coast and the Anti-Atlas range. To the north, in the direction of Marrakech, the range descends less abruptly.\nThe range includes Jbel Toubkal, which at 4,167 m (2.589 mi; 13,671 ft) is the highest in the range and lies in Toubkal National Park.\nThe range serves as a weather system barrier in Morocco running east\u2013west and separating the Sahara from the Mediterranean and continental zones to the north and west. In the higher elevations of the massif, snow falls regularly, allowing winter sports. Snow lasts well into late spring in the High Atlas, mostly on the northern faces of the range. On the Western High Atlas, there is Ouka\u00efmeden, one of three main ski stations in Morocco.\nThe High Atlas forms the basins for a multiplicity of river systems. The majority of the year-round rivers flow to the north, providing the basis for the settlements there. A number of wadis and seasonal rivers terminate in the deserts to the south and plateaux to the east of the mountains.\nThe High-Atlas Mountains are inhabited by Berbers, who live from agriculture and pastoralism in the valleys. In the steppe zone of the High-Atlas, where precipitations are low, the locals created a smart technique in managing the low precipitations and the weak soil. They turn the rather semi-arid lands into fertile valleys called locally by Agdal (garden in Berber).

To the west are Dennis Flats, Starr Valley, and remote Greys Lake, while to the east are Chimney Rock, Clover Valley, and popular Angel Lake.  The summit is the start of a high crest running almost 10 miles (16 km) to the south.\nThe peak is named after Enoch Grey, an early homesteader in nearby Starr Valley. East Humboldt Range: The East Humboldt Range is a mountain range in Elko County, Nevada, United States.  It is located along the eastern edge of the upper watershed of the Humboldt River, which flows to the southwest from its source just north of the range.  The range reaches a maximum elevation of 11,306 feet (3,446 m) atop Hole in the Mountain Peak. Most of the range is included within the Ruby Mountains Ranger District of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. In 1989, the United States Congress passed the Nevada Wilderness Protection Act establishing over 36,000 acres (150 km2) of the range as the East Humboldt Wilderness.  The range takes its name from the Humboldt River. The name ultimately is derived from the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt.\nThe East Humboldts run north-to-south for approximately 30 miles (48 km).  To the north are Interstate 80 and the community of Wells, while to the south are Secret Pass, the larger Ruby Range, and Ruby Valley.  To the east are Clover Valley and U.S. Route 93, and to the west are Starr Valley and Dennis Flats.\nThese mountains were formed by a tilted fault-block process, with gradual slopes and valleys to the west and a steep escarpment to the east.  Both sides of the range show extensive evidence of glaciation during recent ice ages, including U-shaped canyons, moraines, and steeply carved granite mountains, cliffs, and cirques.  All of these features can be seen from the 12 mi (19 km) paved road from Wells to scenic Angel Lake.\nThe range begins with a dramatic rise from a point near the source of the Humboldt River and the community of Wells, at an elevation of 5,650 feet (1,720 m), to the summit of Greys Peak at 10,674 feet (3,253 m).  From there, the range continues south for nearly 10 miles (16 km) as a high crest, staying mostly above 10,000 feet (3,000 m).  The center section of this crest includes the range high point, Hole in the Mountain Peak.  The southernmost high summit of the range is Humboldt Peak (11,020 ft (3,360 m)), after which the main crest begins a gradual descent, forming the northeastern slopes of Secret Pass and the eastern side of North Ruby Valley.\nThe range includes many glacial tarns, including Angel Lake, Smith Lake, Greys Lake, and Winchell Lake to the north, and Lizzie's Basin, Boulder Lakes, and Steele Lake in the central section.\nHiking trails run from Secret Pass up the western side of the range all the way around to Angel Lake, from Angel Lake to nearby Smith Lake, and from a trailhead near Angel Lake down the east side of the range to Winchell Lake and Lizzie's Basin.

It is considered a holy site. The hills are so called because of their dark appearance from a distance, as they are covered in evergreen trees.\nNative Americans have a long history in the Black Hills and consider it a sacred site. After conquering the Cheyenne in 1776, the Lakota took the territory of the Black Hills, which became central to their culture. In 1868, the U.S. government signed the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, establishing the Great Sioux Reservation west of the Missouri River, and exempting the Black Hills from all white settlement forever. When settlers discovered gold here as a result of George Armstrong Custer's Black Hills Expedition in 1874, a gold rush swept in miners. The US government took the Black Hills and forcibly relocated the Lakota, following the Great Sioux War of 1876, to five smaller reservations in western South Dakota, selling off 9 million acres (36,000 km2) of their former land. Unlike most of South Dakota, the Black Hills were settled by European Americans primarily from population centers to the west and south of the region, as miners flocked there from earlier gold boom locations in Colorado and Montana.\nAs the economy of the Black Hills has shifted away from natural resources (mining and timber) since the late 20th century, the hospitality and tourism industries have grown to take its place. Locals tend to divide the Black Hills into two areas: \"The Southern Hills\" and \"The Northern Hills.\" The Southern Hills is home to Mount Rushmore, Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, Black Elk Peak (the highest point in the United States east of the Rockies), Custer State Park (the largest state park in South Dakota), the Crazy Horse Memorial, and The Mammoth Site in Hot Springs, the world's largest mammoth research facility.\nAttractions in the Northern Hills include Spearfish Canyon, historic Deadwood, and the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, held each August. The first Rally was held on August 14, 1938, and the 75th Rally in 2015 saw more than one million bikers visit the Black Hills.

The mountain range's name derives from its proximity to the sea coast, and it is often referred to as the Coast Range. The range includes volcanic and non-volcanic mountains and the extensive ice fields of the Pacific and Boundary Ranges, and the northern end of the volcanic system known as the Cascade Volcanoes. The Coast Mountains are part of a larger mountain system called the Pacific Coast Ranges or the Pacific Mountain System, which includes the Cascade Range, the Insular Mountains, the Olympic Mountains, the Oregon Coast Range, the California Coast Ranges, the Saint Elias Mountains and the Chugach Mountains.

Alps: The Alps () are one of the highest and most extensive mountain ranges in Europe, stretching approximately 1,200 km (750 mi) across eight Alpine countries (from west to east): Monaco, France, Switzerland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Germany, Austria and Slovenia.\nThe Alpine arch extends from Nice on the western Mediterranean to Trieste on the Adriatic and Vienna at the beginning of the Pannonian Basin. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening  caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn.\nMont Blanc spans the French\u2013Italian border, and at 4,809 m (15,778 ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains 128 peaks higher than 4,000 m (13,000 ft).\nThe altitude and size of the range affect the climate in Europe; in the mountains, precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones. Wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of 3,400 m (11,155 ft), and plants such as edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations.\nEvidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the Palaeolithic era. A mummified man (\"\u00d6tzi\"), determined to be 5,000 years old, was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian\u2013Italian border in 1991.\nBy the 6th century BC, the Celtic La T\u00e8ne culture was well established. Hannibal notably crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants, and the Romans had settlements in the region. In 1800, Napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000. The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists, writers, and artists, in particular, the Romanticists, followed by the golden age of alpinism as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks of the Alps.\nThe Alpine region has a strong cultural identity. Traditional practices such as farming, cheesemaking, and woodworking still thrive in Alpine villages. However, the tourist industry began to grow early in the 20th century and expanded significantly after World War II, eventually becoming the dominant industry by the end of the century.\nThe Winter Olympic Games have been hosted in the Swiss, French, Italian, Austrian and German Alps.

General Grant Grove's best-known tree is called General Grant, which is 267 ft (81 m) tall and the third-largest known tree in the world. The General Grant tree is over 1,500 years old and is known as the United States' national Christmas tree. General Grant Grove consists of 154 acres (0.62 km2) and is geographically isolated from the rest of Kings Canyon National Park. Sierra Nevada: The Sierra Nevada ( see-ERR-\u0259 niv-A(H)D-\u0259) is a mountain range in the Western United States, between the Central Valley of California and the Great Basin. The vast majority of the range lies in the state of California, although the Carson Range spur lies primarily in Nevada. The Sierra Nevada is part of the American Cordillera, an almost continuous chain of mountain ranges that forms the western \"backbone\" of the Americas.\nThe Sierra runs 400 miles (640 km) north-south and its width ranges from 50 miles (80 km) to 80 miles (130 km) across east\u2013west. Notable features include General Sherman, the largest tree in the world by volume; Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney at 14,505 ft (4,421 m), the highest point in the contiguous United States; and Yosemite Valley sculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old granite, containing high waterfalls. The Sierra is home to three national parks, twenty-six wilderness areas, ten national forests, and two national monuments. These areas include Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks; and Devils Postpile National Monument.\nMore than one hundred million years ago during the Nevadan orogeny, granite formed deep underground. The range started to uplift less than five million years ago, and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range. The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada, which are reflected by the presence of five life zones (areas with similar plant and animal communities). Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces, creating spectacular fault block escarpments along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra.\nThe Sierra Nevada has played an important role in the history of California and the United States.

Monadhliath Mountains: The Monadhliath Mountains , or Monadh Liath, are a range of mountains in Scotland. Monadh Liath is Scottish Gaelic, and means \"grey mountain range\". Running in a northeast to southwest direction, it lies on the western side of Strathspey, to the west of the Cairngorms and to the south east of Loch Ness. Its southwestern limit is usually taken to be Corrieyairack Pass (763m) but similar uplands continue to Glen Roy and Spean Bridge. The range is within the Highland council area, and the south and east fringes are within the Cairngorms National Park. The high point of the range is C\u00e0rn Dearg, at 945 metres (3,100 ft), located 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of Inverness. This is one of four Munros in the Monadhliath, the others being A'Chailleach (930 metres (3,050 ft)), Geal Ch\u00e0rn (926 metres (3,038 ft)), and C\u00e0rn Sgulain (920 metres (3,020 ft)). The Monadhliath Mountains are designated a Special Area of Conservation (SAC).\nThe Monadh Liath differs greatly in character from the greater Highland mountains to the south and west, as an elevated moorland with no proper ridges.  The four Munros are all on the Spey rim, three making a classic circuit from Newtonmore; the interior is rarely visited. The main valley within the Monadh Liath is the Findhorn. It is unusually sinuous, being an incised meandering river valley very little altered by glaciers.\nThe landscape of the Monadh Liath is one of the most ancient in Britain, its essentials as a secondary massif flanking the Cairngorms having evolved continuously since the Caledonian Mountains were created over 400 million years ago.  Thus the land surface still slopes gently northwest towards the Great Glen, away from the main Grampian divide which crosses the Cairngorms.\nAlthough icesheets have repeatedly covered the Monadh Liath, they have done little to change its character: there are no corries away from the Munros fringe, and only a few short glaciated troughs, notably Glen Killin on the north.  It has just become recognised that thin ice on the plateau is frozen to the ground, but as it starts to flow into the troughs it thickens, accelerates, and warms up so it can erode and enlarge them. This has occurred as recently as the last (Younger Dryas) glacial period ~12000 years ago.\nThe interior of the Monadh Liath is remote and desolate, with little remaining native tree cover. This is a result of human activity, deforestation and overgrazing by sheep and deer over the last thousand years, in common with much of the Scottish Highlands. The renewable energy gold rush has already led to the Glendoe hydro-electric scheme above Fort Augustus. The actual reservoir and dam are not unduly intrusive, but the extensive network of heavy-duty access roads to service all the weirs diverting water into the catchment have altered its remoteness and wildness.  These roads have also facilitated a very large wind energy project, one of several encouraged by proximity to the high-capacity Beauly-Denny power transmission line over Corrieyairack Pass, and which now dominate the NW Grampian skyline in views from the Cairngorms and Western Highlands up to 50 miles (80 kilometres) away. Scottish Highlands: The Highlands (Scots: the Hielands; Scottish Gaelic: a' Gh\u00e0idhealtachd [\u0259 \u02c8\u0263\u025b\u02d0\u0259l\u032a\u02e0t\u032a\u02b0\u0259xk], lit.\u2009'the place of the Gaels') is a historical region of Scotland. Culturally, the Highlands and the Lowlands diverged from the Late Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots language replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands. The Scottish Gaelic name of A' Gh\u00e0idhealtachd literally means \"the place of the Gaels\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands.\nThe area is very sparsely populated, with many mountain ranges dominating the region, and includes the highest mountain in the British Isles, Ben Nevis. During the 18th and early 19th centuries the population of the Highlands rose to around 300,000, but from c. 1841 and for the next 160 years, the natural increase in population was exceeded by emigration (mostly to Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and migration to the industrial cities of Scotland and England.):\u200axxiii,\u200a414 and passim\u200a The area is now one of the most sparsely populated in Europe. At 9.1/km2 (24/sq mi) in 2012, the population density in the Highlands and Islands is less than one seventh of Scotland's as a whole.\nThe Highland Council is the administrative body for much of the Highlands, with its administrative centre at Inverness. However, the Highlands also includes parts of the council areas of Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Moray, North Ayrshire, Perth and Kinross, Stirling and West Dunbartonshire.\nThe Scottish Highlands is the only area in the British Isles to have the taiga biome as it features concentrated populations of Scots pine forest: see Caledonian Forest.

Cardamom Hills: The Cardamom Hills or Yela Mala are mountain range of southern India and part of the southern Western Ghats located in Idukki district, Kerala, India. Their name comes from the cardamom spice grown in much of the hills' cool elevation, which also supports pepper and coffee. The Western Ghats and Periyar Sub-Cluster including the Cardamom Hills are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Western Ghats: The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadris, is a mountain range that stretches 1,600 km (990 mi) along the western coast of the Indian peninsula. Covering an area of 160,000 km2 (62,000 sq mi), it traverses the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The range forms an almost continuous chain of mountains along the western edge of the Deccan Plateau from the Tapti river to the southern tip of the Indian peninsula at Kanniyakumari. The Western Ghats meets with the Eastern Ghats at Nilgiris before continuing south.\nGeologic evidence indicates that the mountains were formed during the break-up of the supercontinent of Gondwana. The mountains came along the west coast of India somewhere in the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous period when India separated from the African continent. The mountains can be roughly divided into three parts, northern section with elevation ranging from 900\u20131,500 m (3,000\u20134,900 ft), middle section starting from south of Goa with a lower elevation of less than 900 m (3,000 ft) and the southern section where the altitude rises again. The Western Ghats have several peaks that rise above 2,000 m (6,600 ft), with Anamudi (2,695 m (8,842 ft)) being the highest peak. The average elevation is around 1,200 m (3,900 ft).\nThe Western Ghats form one of the major watersheds of India, feeding many perennial river systems that drain almost 40% of the land area of the country. Because of the higher elevation of the Deccan plateau on the west, most rivers flow from eastwards towards the Bay of Bengal, resulting in chiselled eastern slopes and steeper western slopes, facing the Arabian Sea. The Western Ghats plays an important role in determining the climate and seasons in India. It blocks the rain bearing monsoon winds flowing eastward from the Arabian Sea, resulting in rainfall along the western coast. By the time the air rises above the mountains, it becomes dry, forming a rain shadow region with very less rainfall on the leeward side towards the interior of the Deccan plateau. \nThe Western Ghats region is a biodiversity hotspot. It contains of a large number of different species of flora and fauna, significant of which are endemic to this region. At least 325 globally threatened species occur in the Western Ghats.

The highest mountain outside Asia, Argentina's Aconcagua, rises to an elevation of about 6,961 m (22,838 ft) above sea level. The peak of Chimborazo in the Ecuadorian Andes is farther from the Earth's center than any other location on the Earth's surface, due to the equatorial bulge resulting from the Earth's rotation. The world's highest volcanoes are in the Andes, including Ojos del Salado on the Chile-Argentina border, which rises to 6,893 m (22,615 ft).\nThe Andes are also part of the American Cordillera, a chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western \"backbone\" of the Americas and Antarctica.", "actual": "1", "rationale": "To evaluate the truth value of the statement \"mountain range(Huch'uy Sara Sara, Andes)\" in the given hypothetical world, we need to determine if Huch'uy Sara Sara belongs to the Andes mountain range.", "predicted": "1"}, {"predicate": "mountain range", "arguments": "Alexandria on the Caucasus, Hindu Kush", "world": "mountain range: range or subrange to which the geographical item belongs.

It stretches from central and eastern Afghanistan into northwestern Pakistan and far southeastern Tajikistan. The range forms the western section of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Region (HKH); to the north, near its northeastern end, the Hindu Kush buttresses the Pamir Mountains near the point where the borders of China, Pakistan and Afghanistan meet, after which it runs southwest through Pakistan and into Afghanistan near their border. \nThe eastern end of the Hindu Kush in the north merges with the Karakoram Range. Towards its southern end, it connects with the White Mountains near the Kabul River. It divides the valley of the Amu Darya (the ancient Oxus) to the north from the Indus River valley to the south. The range has numerous high snow-capped peaks, with the highest point being Tirich Mir or Terichmir at 7,708 metres (25,289 ft) in the Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.\nThe Hindu Kush range region was a historically a significant center of Hinduism, and later Buddhism, with sites such as the Bamiyan Buddhas. The range and communities settled in it hosted ancient monasteries, important trade networks and travelers between Central Asia and South Asia. While the vast majority of the region has been majority-Muslim for several centuries now, certain portions of the Hindu Kush only became Islamized relatively recently, such as Kafiristan, which retained ancient polytheistic beliefs until the 19th century when it was converted to Islam by the Durrani Empire and renamed Nuristan (\"land of light\").

The 2,258-metre (7,408 ft) tall mountain is located in the Jotunheimen mountains within Jotunheimen National Park. The mountain sits about 35 kilometres (22 mi) southwest of the village of V\u00e5g\u00e5mo. The mountain is surrounded by several other notable mountains including Hindnubben and Stornubben to the northeast; Heranosh\u00f8i to the north; Glittertinden to the northwest; Nautgardsoksli, Austre Hestl\u00e6gerh\u00f8e, and Vestre Hestl\u00e6gerh\u00f8e to the west; Bessh\u00f8 to the south; and Russlirundh\u00f8e to the east. \nThe mountain is situated on the absolute eastern flank of Jotunheimen between the Veodalen and Sjodalen valleys and is the southernmost and highest summit on a rather long ridge containing six other 2,000-metre (6,600 ft) peaks. The summit can be observed along parts of County Road 51 from B\u00e5tskaret in the south to Hinds\u00e6ter in the north. From the south it is an almost perfect cone, and with fresh snow covering the peak, it is a sight admired by many tourists. \nThe summit is easily climbed from Sjodalen valley either from Hinds\u00e6ter Mountain Lodge, which is the longer route, or from the confluence of the Russa and Sjoa rivers. Both ways the route will start in low birch forest and gradually enter long talus slopes and plains with many snow patches in the summer.  In the winter, the summit is easily reached, but one should be very wary about the proximity of the northern wall, falling 500 metres (1,600 ft) into Nautgarden. From Hinds\u00e6ter the rest of the summits in the massif is also reached on a rather long day hike. The views are enormous. There are no peaks in southern and eastern direction reaching higher than 1,850 metres (6,070 ft), and you see almost all of the eastern Oppland highlands. Theoretically you can see the hills north of Oslo, but it might be difficult to discern them. Sn\u00f8hetta, the Rondane mountain range and all the mountains of Valdres, like Bitihorn can be seen from this summit.

Roche Bonhomme is composed of Permian and Carboniferous strata topped by darker Triassic siltstone of the Sulphur Mountain Formation. Grampian Mountains: The Grampian Mountains (Scottish Gaelic: Am Monadh) is one of the three major mountain ranges in Scotland, that together occupy about half of Scotland. The other two ranges are the Northwest Highlands and the Southern Uplands. The Grampian range extends southwest to northeast between the Highland Boundary Fault and the Great Glen.

The Canadian Rockies, being the northern segment of this chain, is thus defined as comprising the central-eastern section of the North American Cordillera, between the Prairies of Alberta and the Liard Plain of northeastern British Columbia to the east and the Interior Mountains/Plateau and Columbia Mountains to the west. It is divided into the Northern Rockies (which is further subdivided into the Muskwa and Hart Ranges) and Continental Ranges, separated by the McGregor River valley, the McGregor Pass and the Kakwa River valley.\nThe southern end of the Canadian Rockies extends into the U.S. state of Montana at various sites such as the Wilson Range, Upper Waterton Lake, Boundary Creek, Cameron Lake, Forum Peak, Long Knife Peak, North Fork Flathead River and Frozen Lake. In geographic terms, the boundary is at the Canada\u2013United States border on 49th parallel north, but in geological terms it might be considered to be at Marias Pass in northern Montana.\nThe Canadian Rockies have numerous high peaks and ranges, such as Mount Robson (3,954 metres; 12,972 feet) and Mount Columbia (3,747 m; 12,293 ft).

Monadhliath Mountains: The Monadhliath Mountains , or Monadh Liath, are a range of mountains in Scotland. Monadh Liath is Scottish Gaelic, and means \"grey mountain range\". Running in a northeast to southwest direction, it lies on the western side of Strathspey, to the west of the Cairngorms and to the south east of Loch Ness. Its southwestern limit is usually taken to be Corrieyairack Pass (763m) but similar uplands continue to Glen Roy and Spean Bridge. The range is within the Highland council area, and the south and east fringes are within the Cairngorms National Park. The high point of the range is C\u00e0rn Dearg, at 945 metres (3,100 ft), located 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of Inverness. This is one of four Munros in the Monadhliath, the others being A'Chailleach (930 metres (3,050 ft)), Geal Ch\u00e0rn (926 metres (3,038 ft)), and C\u00e0rn Sgulain (920 metres (3,020 ft)). The Monadhliath Mountains are designated a Special Area of Conservation (SAC).\nThe Monadh Liath differs greatly in character from the greater Highland mountains to the south and west, as an elevated moorland with no proper ridges.  The four Munros are all on the Spey rim, three making a classic circuit from Newtonmore; the interior is rarely visited. The main valley within the Monadh Liath is the Findhorn. It is unusually sinuous, being an incised meandering river valley very little altered by glaciers.\nThe landscape of the Monadh Liath is one of the most ancient in Britain, its essentials as a secondary massif flanking the Cairngorms having evolved continuously since the Caledonian Mountains were created over 400 million years ago.  Thus the land surface still slopes gently northwest towards the Great Glen, away from the main Grampian divide which crosses the Cairngorms.\nAlthough icesheets have repeatedly covered the Monadh Liath, they have done little to change its character: there are no corries away from the Munros fringe, and only a few short glaciated troughs, notably Glen Killin on the north.  It has just become recognised that thin ice on the plateau is frozen to the ground, but as it starts to flow into the troughs it thickens, accelerates, and warms up so it can erode and enlarge them. This has occurred as recently as the last (Younger Dryas) glacial period ~12000 years ago.\nThe interior of the Monadh Liath is remote and desolate, with little remaining native tree cover. This is a result of human activity, deforestation and overgrazing by sheep and deer over the last thousand years, in common with much of the Scottish Highlands. The renewable energy gold rush has already led to the Glendoe hydro-electric scheme above Fort Augustus. The actual reservoir and dam are not unduly intrusive, but the extensive network of heavy-duty access roads to service all the weirs diverting water into the catchment have altered its remoteness and wildness.  These roads have also facilitated a very large wind energy project, one of several encouraged by proximity to the high-capacity Beauly-Denny power transmission line over Corrieyairack Pass, and which now dominate the NW Grampian skyline in views from the Cairngorms and Western Highlands up to 50 miles (80 kilometres) away. Darwin Mountains: The Darwin Mountains (79\u00b051\u2032S 156\u00b015\u2032E) are a group of mountains between the Darwin Glacier and Hatherton Glacier in Antarctica.

The pass forms a gateway between northwestern Sichuan (Ngawa) and southern Gansu. It is of historical significance due to its strategic importance in the final phase of the Long March.\nDuring the Long March, the Lazikou Pass was the last major obstacle for the forces led by Mao Zedong (i.e. Red Army of China) to reach northern Gansu after their crossing of the Zoig\u00ea Marsh. The pass had been fortified with blockhouses by Kuomintang forces and was taken by mountaineers led by Yang Chengwu on September 16, 1935.\nIn 2014, the 3,735 m long Lazikou Tunnel was completed, which bypasses the mountain pass. Dinaric Alps: The Dinaric Alps (), also Dinarides, are a mountain range in Southern and Southcentral Europe, separating the continental Balkan Peninsula from the Adriatic Sea. They stretch from Italy in the northwest through Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo to Albania in the southeast.\nThe Dinaric Alps extend for approximately 645 kilometres (401 mi) along the western Balkan Peninsula from the Julian Alps of the northeast Italy, downwards to the \u0160ar and Korab massif, where their direction changes. The Accursed Mountains are the highest section of the entire Dinaric Alps; this section stretches from Albania to Kosovo and eastern Montenegro. Maja Jezerc\u00eb, standing at 2,694 metres (8,839 ft) above the Adriatic, is the highest peak and is located in Albania.\nThe Dinaric Alps are one of the most rugged and extensive mountainous areas of Europe, alongside the Caucasus Mountains, Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathian Mountains and Scandinavian Mountains. They are formed largely of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks of dolomite, limestone, sandstone and conglomerates formed by seas and lakes that once covered the area. During the Alpine earth movements that occurred 50 to 100 million years ago, immense lateral pressures folded and overthrust the rocks in a great arc around the old rigid block of the northeast. The main tectonic phase of the orogenesis in the area of the Dinaric Karst took place in Cenozoic Era (Paleogene) as a result of the Adriatic Microplate (Adria) collision with Europe, and the process is still active.

The Andes extend from South to North through seven South American countries.:  Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador,  Colombia and western Venezuela.\nAlong their length, the Andes are split into several ranges, separated by intermediate depressions. The Andes are the location of several high plateaus\u2014some of which host major cities such as Quito, Bogot\u00e1, Cali, Arequipa, Medell\u00edn, Bucaramanga, Sucre, M\u00e9rida, El Alto and La Paz. The Altiplano Plateau is the world's second-highest after the Tibetan Plateau. These ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate: the Tropical Andes, the Dry Andes, and the Wet Andes.\nThe Andes Mountains are the highest mountain range outside Asia. The highest mountain outside Asia, Argentina's Aconcagua, rises to an elevation of about 6,961 m (22,838 ft) above sea level. The peak of Chimborazo in the Ecuadorian Andes is farther from the Earth's center than any other location on the Earth's surface, due to the equatorial bulge resulting from the Earth's rotation.

They are formed largely of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks of dolomite, limestone, sandstone and conglomerates formed by seas and lakes that once covered the area. During the Alpine earth movements that occurred 50 to 100 million years ago, immense lateral pressures folded and overthrust the rocks in a great arc around the old rigid block of the northeast. The main tectonic phase of the orogenesis in the area of the Dinaric Karst took place in Cenozoic Era (Paleogene) as a result of the Adriatic Microplate (Adria) collision with Europe, and the process is still active.

Culturally, the Highlands and the Lowlands diverged from the Late Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots language replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands.

In the northwest they join with the Ligurian Alps at Altare. In the southwest they end at Reggio di Calabria, the coastal city at the tip of the peninsula. Since 2000 the Environment Ministry of Italy, following the recommendations of the Apennines Park of Europe Project, has been defining the Apennines System to include the mountains of north Sicily, for a total distance of 1,500 kilometres (930 mi). The system forms an arc enclosing the east side of the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas.\nThe Apennines conserve some intact ecosystems that have survived human intervention. In these are some of the best preserved forests and montane grasslands in Europe, now protected by national parks and, within them, a high diversity of flora and fauna. These mountains are one of the last refuges of the big European predators such as the Italian wolf and the Marsican brown bear, now extinct in the rest of Central Europe.\nThe mountains lend their name to the Apennine peninsula that forms the major part of Italy. They are mostly verdant, although one side of the highest peak, Corno Grande, is partially covered by Calderone glacier, the only glacier in the Apennines.

From 1535 to 1565, it was the home to the Margraves of Baden-Durlach.\nThe City of Pforzheim is a Stadtkreis, meaning it is both a municipality and a district at the same time. Also, it hosts the administrative offices of the Enz district that surrounds the city.\nDuring World War II, Pforzheim was bombed by the Allies a number of times. The largest raid, and one of the most devastating area bombardments of World War II, was carried out by the Royal Air Force (RAF) on the evening of 23 February 1945. Nearly one third of the town's population, 17,600 people, were killed in the air raid, and about 83% of the town's buildings were destroyed. The Allies believed that precision instruments were being produced here for use in the German war effort and that the town was a transport centre for the movement of German troops.\nFrom 1945 to 1948, Pforzheim (after the initial French occupation) was administered by the United States military and was part of the short-lived state of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden. In the 20 years following the end of the war, Pforzheim was gradually rebuilt. The town reflects the architecture of the postwar period and has some landmark buildings of the 1950s.

Monadhliath Mountains: The Monadhliath Mountains , or Monadh Liath, are a range of mountains in Scotland. Monadh Liath is Scottish Gaelic, and means \"grey mountain range\". Running in a northeast to southwest direction, it lies on the western side of Strathspey, to the west of the Cairngorms and to the south east of Loch Ness. Its southwestern limit is usually taken to be Corrieyairack Pass (763m) but similar uplands continue to Glen Roy and Spean Bridge. The range is within the Highland council area, and the south and east fringes are within the Cairngorms National Park. The high point of the range is C\u00e0rn Dearg, at 945 metres (3,100 ft), located 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of Inverness. This is one of four Munros in the Monadhliath, the others being A'Chailleach (930 metres (3,050 ft)), Geal Ch\u00e0rn (926 metres (3,038 ft)), and C\u00e0rn Sgulain (920 metres (3,020 ft)). The Monadhliath Mountains are designated a Special Area of Conservation (SAC).\nThe Monadh Liath differs greatly in character from the greater Highland mountains to the south and west, as an elevated moorland with no proper ridges.  The four Munros are all on the Spey rim, three making a classic circuit from Newtonmore; the interior is rarely visited. The main valley within the Monadh Liath is the Findhorn. It is unusually sinuous, being an incised meandering river valley very little altered by glaciers.\nThe landscape of the Monadh Liath is one of the most ancient in Britain, its essentials as a secondary massif flanking the Cairngorms having evolved continuously since the Caledonian Mountains were created over 400 million years ago.  Thus the land surface still slopes gently northwest towards the Great Glen, away from the main Grampian divide which crosses the Cairngorms.\nAlthough icesheets have repeatedly covered the Monadh Liath, they have done little to change its character: there are no corries away from the Munros fringe, and only a few short glaciated troughs, notably Glen Killin on the north.  It has just become recognised that thin ice on the plateau is frozen to the ground, but as it starts to flow into the troughs it thickens, accelerates, and warms up so it can erode and enlarge them. This has occurred as recently as the last (Younger Dryas) glacial period ~12000 years ago.\nThe interior of the Monadh Liath is remote and desolate, with little remaining native tree cover. This is a result of human activity, deforestation and overgrazing by sheep and deer over the last thousand years, in common with much of the Scottish Highlands. The renewable energy gold rush has already led to the Glendoe hydro-electric scheme above Fort Augustus. The actual reservoir and dam are not unduly intrusive, but the extensive network of heavy-duty access roads to service all the weirs diverting water into the catchment have altered its remoteness and wildness.  These roads have also facilitated a very large wind energy project, one of several encouraged by proximity to the high-capacity Beauly-Denny power transmission line over Corrieyairack Pass, and which now dominate the NW Grampian skyline in views from the Cairngorms and Western Highlands up to 50 miles (80 kilometres) away. Scottish Highlands: The Highlands (Scots: the Hielands; Scottish Gaelic: a' Gh\u00e0idhealtachd [\u0259 \u02c8\u0263\u025b\u02d0\u0259l\u032a\u02e0t\u032a\u02b0\u0259xk], lit.\u2009'the place of the Gaels') is a historical region of Scotland. Culturally, the Highlands and the Lowlands diverged from the Late Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots language replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands. The Scottish Gaelic name of A' Gh\u00e0idhealtachd literally means \"the place of the Gaels\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands.\nThe area is very sparsely populated, with many mountain ranges dominating the region, and includes the highest mountain in the British Isles, Ben Nevis. During the 18th and early 19th centuries the population of the Highlands rose to around 300,000, but from c. 1841 and for the next 160 years, the natural increase in population was exceeded by emigration (mostly to Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and migration to the industrial cities of Scotland and England.):\u200axxiii,\u200a414 and passim\u200a The area is now one of the most sparsely populated in Europe. At 9.1/km2 (24/sq mi) in 2012, the population density in the Highlands and Islands is less than one seventh of Scotland's as a whole.\nThe Highland Council is the administrative body for much of the Highlands, with its administrative centre at Inverness. However, the Highlands also includes parts of the council areas of Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Moray, North Ayrshire, Perth and Kinross, Stirling and West Dunbartonshire.\nThe Scottish Highlands is the only area in the British Isles to have the taiga biome as it features concentrated populations of Scots pine forest: see Caledonian Forest.

The summit can be observed along parts of County Road 51 from B\u00e5tskaret in the south to Hinds\u00e6ter in the north. From the south it is an almost perfect cone, and with fresh snow covering the peak, it is a sight admired by many tourists. \nThe summit is easily climbed from Sjodalen valley either from Hinds\u00e6ter Mountain Lodge, which is the longer route, or from the confluence of the Russa and Sjoa rivers. Both ways the route will start in low birch forest and gradually enter long talus slopes and plains with many snow patches in the summer.  In the winter, the summit is easily reached, but one should be very wary about the proximity of the northern wall, falling 500 metres (1,600 ft) into Nautgarden. From Hinds\u00e6ter the rest of the summits in the massif is also reached on a rather long day hike. The views are enormous. There are no peaks in southern and eastern direction reaching higher than 1,850 metres (6,070 ft), and you see almost all of the eastern Oppland highlands. Theoretically you can see the hills north of Oslo, but it might be difficult to discern them. Sn\u00f8hetta, the Rondane mountain range and all the mountains of Valdres, like Bitihorn can be seen from this summit. To the west many of the summits in Jotunheimen can be admired - most prominent among them from this vantage point - Glittertind, the distant neighbor to the northwest. Allardyce Range: The Allardyce Range (Spanish: Cordillera de San Telmo) is a mountain range rising south of Cumberland Bay and dominating the central part of South Georgia, a UK overseas territory. It extends for 50 km (31 mi) from Mount Globus in the northwest to Mount Brooker in the southeast, with peaks of 2,000 to 2,935 m (6,562 to 9,629 ft) and including Mount Paget (2,935 m or 9,629 ft) the highest peak of the range and also the highest point in the UK territory. Other peaks of the range include Mount Roots.\nAlthough not shown on the charts of South Georgia by Cook in 1775 or Bellingshausen in 1819, peaks of this range were doubtless seen by those explorers.

The Canadian Rockies, being the northern segment of this chain, is thus defined as comprising the central-eastern section of the North American Cordillera, between the Prairies of Alberta and the Liard Plain of northeastern British Columbia to the east and the Interior Mountains/Plateau and Columbia Mountains to the west. It is divided into the Northern Rockies (which is further subdivided into the Muskwa and Hart Ranges) and Continental Ranges, separated by the McGregor River valley, the McGregor Pass and the Kakwa River valley.\nThe southern end of the Canadian Rockies extends into the U.S. state of Montana at various sites such as the Wilson Range, Upper Waterton Lake, Boundary Creek, Cameron Lake, Forum Peak, Long Knife Peak, North Fork Flathead River and Frozen Lake. In geographic terms, the boundary is at the Canada\u2013United States border on 49th parallel north, but in geological terms it might be considered to be at Marias Pass in northern Montana.\nThe Canadian Rockies have numerous high peaks and ranges, such as Mount Robson (3,954 metres; 12,972 feet) and Mount Columbia (3,747 m; 12,293 ft).

They are part of the Blue Ridge Mountain Province of the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  The Unicois are located immediately south of the Great Smoky Mountains and immediately west of the Cheoah Mountains.  Most of the range is protected as a national forest, namely the Cherokee National Forest on the Tennessee side and the Nantahala National Forest on the North Carolina side\u2014 although some parts have been designated as wilderness areas and are thus more strictly regulated.\nThe Unicoi Mountains remain one of the most primitive, undeveloped areas in the eastern United States.  Human habitation in the range's river valleys and deep hollows was never dense. While logging occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, logging operations in the Unicoi area were not as extensive as in other forested areas in the region.  \nThe Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest, located in the northeastern Unicois, is home to one of the last remaining old growth cove hardwood forests in the eastern United States.  Grassy balds and heath balds are seen atop summits in the Unicoi Mountains, the highest of which rise to elevations of over 5,000 feet.  The Cherohala Skyway\u2014 a National Scenic Byway completed in 1996\u2014 traverses the crest of the Unicoi Mountains connecting Tellico Plains, Tennessee with Robbinsville, North Carolina.\nThe name \"Unicoi\" comes from the Cherokee word \u13a4\u13c1\u13a6 (unega), which means \"white.\"  It refers to the low-lying clouds and fog that often drape the Southern Appalachian mountains in the early morning or on humid or moist days.  The name Unaka\u2014 which historically refers to the mountains along the Tennessee\u2013North Carolina border\u2014 has the same Cherokee root as \"Unicoi.\" There it is said to be associated with the white of the long chestnut blooms that were prevalent in spring in the mountains, before the Chestnut blight. Blue Ridge Mountains: The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Highlands range. The mountain range is located in the Eastern United States and extends 550 miles southwest from southern Pennsylvania through Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. The province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range.\nThe Blue Ridge Mountains are known for having a bluish color when seen from a distance. Trees put the \"blue\" in Blue Ridge, from the isoprene released into the atmosphere. This contributes to the characteristic haze on the mountains and their perceived color.\nWithin the Blue Ridge province are two major national parks: the Shenandoah National Park in the northern section and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the southern section. The Blue Ridge Parkway, a 469-mile (755 km) long scenic highway, connects the two parks and runs along the ridge crest-lines, as does the Appalachian Trail.

These mountains, together with other scattered peaks, form an arc about 420 km (260 mi) long, extending from the vicinity of Mount Starlight in the north to Goodspeed Nunataks in the south.\nThese mountains were first observed and photographed from a distance by airmen of USN Operation Highjump, 1946\u201347. They were examined by several ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) parties and mapped in the years 1954\u201361. They have been found to contain large deposits of iron ore. They were named by ANCA in 1956 for King Charles III, then the eight-year-old Prince Charles and son of the late Queen Elizabeth II.", "actual": "0", "rationale": "To evaluate the truth value of the statement \"mountain range(Yawriwiri, Prince Charles Mountains)\" in the given hypothetical world, we need to determine if Yawriwiri belongs to the Prince Charles Mountains.", "predicted": "0"}, {"predicate": "mountain range", "arguments": "Nautgardstinden, East Humboldt Range", "world": "mountain range: range or subrange to which the geographical item belongs. Nautgardstinden: Nautgardstind or Nautgardstinden is a mountain on the border of V\u00e5g\u00e5 Municipality and Lom Municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. The 2,258-metre (7,408 ft) tall mountain is located in the Jotunheimen mountains within Jotunheimen National Park. The mountain sits about 35 kilometres (22 mi) southwest of the village of V\u00e5g\u00e5mo. The mountain is surrounded by several other notable mountains including Hindnubben and Stornubben to the northeast; Heranosh\u00f8i to the north; Glittertinden to the northwest; Nautgardsoksli, Austre Hestl\u00e6gerh\u00f8e, and Vestre Hestl\u00e6gerh\u00f8e to the west; Bessh\u00f8 to the south; and Russlirundh\u00f8e to the east. \nThe mountain is situated on the absolute eastern flank of Jotunheimen between the Veodalen and Sjodalen valleys and is the southernmost and highest summit on a rather long ridge containing six other 2,000-metre (6,600 ft) peaks. The summit can be observed along parts of County Road 51 from B\u00e5tskaret in the south to Hinds\u00e6ter in the north. From the south it is an almost perfect cone, and with fresh snow covering the peak, it is a sight admired by many tourists. \nThe summit is easily climbed from Sjodalen valley either from Hinds\u00e6ter Mountain Lodge, which is the longer route, or from the confluence of the Russa and Sjoa rivers. Both ways the route will start in low birch forest and gradually enter long talus slopes and plains with many snow patches in the summer.  In the winter, the summit is easily reached, but one should be very wary about the proximity of the northern wall, falling 500 metres (1,600 ft) into Nautgarden. From Hinds\u00e6ter the rest of the summits in the massif is also reached on a rather long day hike. The views are enormous. There are no peaks in southern and eastern direction reaching higher than 1,850 metres (6,070 ft), and you see almost all of the eastern Oppland highlands. Theoretically you can see the hills north of Oslo, but it might be difficult to discern them. Sn\u00f8hetta, the Rondane mountain range and all the mountains of Valdres, like Bitihorn can be seen from this summit. To the west many of the summits in Jotunheimen can be admired - most prominent among them from this vantage point - Glittertind, the distant neighbor to the northwest. East Humboldt Range: The East Humboldt Range is a mountain range in Elko County, Nevada, United States.  It is located along the eastern edge of the upper watershed of the Humboldt River, which flows to the southwest from its source just north of the range.  The range reaches a maximum elevation of 11,306 feet (3,446 m) atop Hole in the Mountain Peak. Most of the range is included within the Ruby Mountains Ranger District of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. In 1989, the United States Congress passed the Nevada Wilderness Protection Act establishing over 36,000 acres (150 km2) of the range as the East Humboldt Wilderness.  The range takes its name from the Humboldt River. The name ultimately is derived from the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt.\nThe East Humboldts run north-to-south for approximately 30 miles (48 km).  To the north are Interstate 80 and the community of Wells, while to the south are Secret Pass, the larger Ruby Range, and Ruby Valley.  To the east are Clover Valley and U.S. Route 93, and to the west are Starr Valley and Dennis Flats.\nThese mountains were formed by a tilted fault-block process, with gradual slopes and valleys to the west and a steep escarpment to the east.  Both sides of the range show extensive evidence of glaciation during recent ice ages, including U-shaped canyons, moraines, and steeply carved granite mountains, cliffs, and cirques.  All of these features can be seen from the 12 mi (19 km) paved road from Wells to scenic Angel Lake.\nThe range begins with a dramatic rise from a point near the source of the Humboldt River and the community of Wells, at an elevation of 5,650 feet (1,720 m), to the summit of Greys Peak at 10,674 feet (3,253 m).  From there, the range continues south for nearly 10 miles (16 km) as a high crest, staying mostly above 10,000 feet (3,000 m).  The center section of this crest includes the range high point, Hole in the Mountain Peak.  The southernmost high summit of the range is Humboldt Peak (11,020 ft (3,360 m)), after which the main crest begins a gradual descent, forming the northeastern slopes of Secret Pass and the eastern side of North Ruby Valley.\nThe range includes many glacial tarns, including Angel Lake, Smith Lake, Greys Lake, and Winchell Lake to the north, and Lizzie's Basin, Boulder Lakes, and Steele Lake in the central section.\nHiking trails run from Secret Pass up the western side of the range all the way around to Angel Lake, from Angel Lake to nearby Smith Lake, and from a trailhead near Angel Lake down the east side of the range to Winchell Lake and Lizzie's Basin.  Public access is principally found at Angel Lake, a trailhead at the west end of Secret Pass, and via a primitive road at Weeks Canyon/Lizzie's Basin.", "actual": "0", "rationale": "To evaluate the truth value of the statement \"mountain range(Nautgardstinden, East Humboldt Range)\" in the given hypothetical world, we need to determine whether Nautgardstinden belongs to the East Humboldt Range.", "predicted": "0"}, {"predicate": "mountain range", "arguments": "Mana Parbat II, Grosvenor Mountains", "world": "mountain range: range or subrange to which the geographical item belongs.

The Andes extend from South to North through seven South American countries.:  Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador,  Colombia and western Venezuela.\nAlong their length, the Andes are split into several ranges, separated by intermediate depressions. The Andes are the location of several high plateaus\u2014some of which host major cities such as Quito, Bogot\u00e1, Cali, Arequipa, Medell\u00edn, Bucaramanga, Sucre, M\u00e9rida, El Alto and La Paz. The Altiplano Plateau is the world's second-highest after the Tibetan Plateau. These ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate: the Tropical Andes, the Dry Andes, and the Wet Andes.\nThe Andes Mountains are the highest mountain range outside Asia. The highest mountain outside Asia, Argentina's Aconcagua, rises to an elevation of about 6,961 m (22,838 ft) above sea level. The peak of Chimborazo in the Ecuadorian Andes is farther from the Earth's center than any other location on the Earth's surface, due to the equatorial bulge resulting from the Earth's rotation.

Black Hills: The Black Hills is an isolated mountain range rising from the Great Plains of North America in western South Dakota and extending into Wyoming, United States. Black Elk Peak, which rises to 7,244 feet (2,208 m), is the range's highest summit. It encompasses the Black Hills National Forest. The name of the range in Lakota is Pah\u00e1 S\u00e1pa. It is considered a holy site. The hills are so called because of their dark appearance from a distance, as they are covered in evergreen trees.\nNative Americans have a long history in the Black Hills and consider it a sacred site. After conquering the Cheyenne in 1776, the Lakota took the territory of the Black Hills, which became central to their culture. In 1868, the U.S. government signed the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, establishing the Great Sioux Reservation west of the Missouri River, and exempting the Black Hills from all white settlement forever. When settlers discovered gold here as a result of George Armstrong Custer's Black Hills Expedition in 1874, a gold rush swept in miners. The US government took the Black Hills and forcibly relocated the Lakota, following the Great Sioux War of 1876, to five smaller reservations in western South Dakota, selling off 9 million acres (36,000 km2) of their former land. Unlike most of South Dakota, the Black Hills were settled by European Americans primarily from population centers to the west and south of the region, as miners flocked there from earlier gold boom locations in Colorado and Montana.\nAs the economy of the Black Hills has shifted away from natural resources (mining and timber) since the late 20th century, the hospitality and tourism industries have grown to take its place. Locals tend to divide the Black Hills into two areas: \"The Southern Hills\" and \"The Northern Hills.\" The Southern Hills is home to Mount Rushmore, Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, Black Elk Peak (the highest point in the United States east of the Rockies), Custer State Park (the largest state park in South Dakota), the Crazy Horse Memorial, and The Mammoth Site in Hot Springs, the world's largest mammoth research facility.\nAttractions in the Northern Hills include Spearfish Canyon, historic Deadwood, and the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, held each August.

Risnjak: Risnjak is a mountain in the Risnjak National Park, in Gorski Kotar, Croatia. It belongs to the Dinaric Alps mountain range. The name of the massif probably comes from ris, the Croatian word for lynx. Another interpretation suggests that it comes from the local word risje, which is a name for a type of grass.\nThe vegetation is very diverse. Thirty different plant communities have been recorded, of which the most common are beech and fir forests (Fagetum illyricum abietotosum) which go up to 1240 m and then are replaced by sub-alpine beeches (Fagetum croaticum subalpinum). The highest vegetation is a belt of mountain pine (Pinetum mughi croaticum). The fauna is also diverse, but has been less well researched. There are particularly many species of birds and mammals, including several types of chamois, while since 1974 the area has once again been inhabited by the ris (lynx).\nThe highest peak of Risnjak mountain is \"Risnjak\" or Veliki Risnjak at 1528 m.a.s.l. (the latter name means \"Big Risnjak\"), and it is also the highest peak in the Risnjak National Park, and the second in Gorski kotar next to Bjelolasica. On its southern slope is located the mountain lodge called \u0160loserov dom, built by Josip Schlosser. The peak can be reached only on foot, from Crni Lug (3 h) or from an unpaved road beginning in Gornje Jelenje (1 h).\nThe highest peaks of Risnjak mountain are: Veliki Risnjak (1528 m), Sjeverni Mali Risnjak (1434 m) and Ju\u017eni Mali Risnjak (1448 m).\n\n Andes: The Andes ( AN-deez), Andes Mountains or Andean Mountain Range (Spanish: Cordillera de los Andes; Quechua: Anti) are the longest continental mountain range in the world, forming a continuous highland along the western edge of South America. The range is 8,900 km (5,530 mi) long and 200 to 700 km (124 to 435 mi) wide (widest between 18\u00b0S and 20\u00b0S latitude) and has an average height of about 4,000 m (13,123 ft). The Andes extend from South to North through seven South American countries.:  Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador,  Colombia and western Venezuela.\nAlong their length, the Andes are split into several ranges, separated by intermediate depressions. The Andes are the location of several high plateaus\u2014some of which host major cities such as Quito, Bogot\u00e1, Cali, Arequipa, Medell\u00edn, Bucaramanga, Sucre, M\u00e9rida, El Alto and La Paz. The Altiplano Plateau is the world's second-highest after the Tibetan Plateau. These ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate: the Tropical Andes, the Dry Andes, and the Wet Andes.\nThe Andes Mountains are the highest mountain range outside Asia. The highest mountain outside Asia, Argentina's Aconcagua, rises to an elevation of about 6,961 m (22,838 ft) above sea level. The peak of Chimborazo in the Ecuadorian Andes is farther from the Earth's center than any other location on the Earth's surface, due to the equatorial bulge resulting from the Earth's rotation.

Mount Teneriffe: Mount Teneriffe in central Victoria, Australia, is a distinctive granite formation, 444 m (1,457 ft) above sea level (200m above plain level). It takes its name from the island of Tenerife in Spain.\nMost of the area is within a nature conservation reserve with impressive granite outcrops at the foot of the mountain. Mount Teneriffe is one of the outliers of the Strathbogie Ranges formed from uplifted Devonian granite, the erosion of which has filled in the once deep valleys and basins of the Upper Goulburn, the Murray Valley and the Victorian Riverina with sediment. The hill is lightly timbered with scattered small trees on the summit. The site is accessed from Alexanderson Rd and then Jefferies Rd and Oak Valley Rd.\nSome rock-climbing crags are present on the north west face, including Sparrow Slabs, Castle Rock, Eagle Rock, and Vertigo Block. Mt. Teneriffe was the site of the 1983 Australian Rogaining championship.

The pass forms a gateway between northwestern Sichuan (Ngawa) and southern Gansu. It is of historical significance due to its strategic importance in the final phase of the Long March.\nDuring the Long March, the Lazikou Pass was the last major obstacle for the forces led by Mao Zedong (i.e. Red Army of China) to reach northern Gansu after their crossing of the Zoig\u00ea Marsh. The pass had been fortified with blockhouses by Kuomintang forces and was taken by mountaineers led by Yang Chengwu on September 16, 1935.\nIn 2014, the 3,735 m long Lazikou Tunnel was completed, which bypasses the mountain pass.

Coast Mountains: The Coast Mountains (French: La cha\u00eene C\u00f4ti\u00e8re) are a major mountain range in the Pacific Coast Ranges of western North America, extending from southwestern Yukon through the Alaska Panhandle and virtually all of the Coast of British Columbia south to the Fraser River. The mountain range's name derives from its proximity to the sea coast, and it is often referred to as the Coast Range. The range includes volcanic and non-volcanic mountains and the extensive ice fields of the Pacific and Boundary Ranges, and the northern end of the volcanic system known as the Cascade Volcanoes. The Coast Mountains are part of a larger mountain system called the Pacific Coast Ranges or the Pacific Mountain System, which includes the Cascade Range, the Insular Mountains, the Olympic Mountains, the Oregon Coast Range, the California Coast Ranges, the Saint Elias Mountains and the Chugach Mountains. The Coast Mountains are also part of the American Cordillera\u2014a Spanish term for an extensive chain of mountain ranges\u2014that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western backbone of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica.\nThe Coast Mountains are approximately 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and average 300 kilometres (190 mi) in width. The range's southern and southeastern boundaries are surrounded by the Fraser River and the Interior Plateau while its far northwestern edge is delimited by the Kelsall and Tatshenshini Rivers at the north end of the Alaska Panhandle, beyond which are the Saint Elias Mountains, and by Champagne Pass in the Yukon Territory. Covered in dense temperate rainforest on its western exposures, the range rises to heavily glaciated peaks, including the largest temperate-latitude ice fields in the world.

A section of the Ulster Way formerly passed around the side of Benaughlin, within 300 m of the summit until it was revised in 2009 and now instead ascends from Florencecourt.\nThe hill was originally called Binn Eachlabhra, which is thought to mean \"peak of the speaking horse\". Locals would climb the hill on the last Sunday of July for the festival of Lughnasa, and folklore tells of a large white horse (An Chopail B\u00e1n) which would appear on the hill each year and speak to them. Benaughlin is also associated with Donn na Binne (\"Donn of the peak\"), the legendary ancestor of the Mag Uidhir (Maguire) chiefs of Fermanagh and a king of the S\u00ed. He is said to dwell in the mountain, and it was believed that whenever any of his real descendants die, a shard falls off its rocky face.\nBenaughlin is also known as Bin Mountain to local residents.\nThe blanket bog which covers Benaughlin was used as a source of fuel for the wealthy landowners in the area who lived in the nearby stately home of Florence Court.

The Sierra Nevada is part of the American Cordillera, an almost continuous chain of mountain ranges that forms the western \"backbone\" of the Americas.\nThe Sierra runs 400 miles (640 km) north-south and its width ranges from 50 miles (80 km) to 80 miles (130 km) across east\u2013west. Notable features include General Sherman, the largest tree in the world by volume; Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney at 14,505 ft (4,421 m), the highest point in the contiguous United States; and Yosemite Valley sculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old granite, containing high waterfalls. The Sierra is home to three national parks, twenty-six wilderness areas, ten national forests, and two national monuments.

Coast Mountains: The Coast Mountains (French: La cha\u00eene C\u00f4ti\u00e8re) are a major mountain range in the Pacific Coast Ranges of western North America, extending from southwestern Yukon through the Alaska Panhandle and virtually all of the Coast of British Columbia south to the Fraser River. The mountain range's name derives from its proximity to the sea coast, and it is often referred to as the Coast Range. The range includes volcanic and non-volcanic mountains and the extensive ice fields of the Pacific and Boundary Ranges, and the northern end of the volcanic system known as the Cascade Volcanoes. The Coast Mountains are part of a larger mountain system called the Pacific Coast Ranges or the Pacific Mountain System, which includes the Cascade Range, the Insular Mountains, the Olympic Mountains, the Oregon Coast Range, the California Coast Ranges, the Saint Elias Mountains and the Chugach Mountains. The Coast Mountains are also part of the American Cordillera\u2014a Spanish term for an extensive chain of mountain ranges\u2014that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western backbone of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica.\nThe Coast Mountains are approximately 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and average 300 kilometres (190 mi) in width. The range's southern and southeastern boundaries are surrounded by the Fraser River and the Interior Plateau while its far northwestern edge is delimited by the Kelsall and Tatshenshini Rivers at the north end of the Alaska Panhandle, beyond which are the Saint Elias Mountains, and by Champagne Pass in the Yukon Territory. Covered in dense temperate rainforest on its western exposures, the range rises to heavily glaciated peaks, including the largest temperate-latitude ice fields in the world.

Andes: The Andes ( AN-deez), Andes Mountains or Andean Mountain Range (Spanish: Cordillera de los Andes; Quechua: Anti) are the longest continental mountain range in the world, forming a continuous highland along the western edge of South America. The range is 8,900 km (5,530 mi) long and 200 to 700 km (124 to 435 mi) wide (widest between 18\u00b0S and 20\u00b0S latitude) and has an average height of about 4,000 m (13,123 ft). The Andes extend from South to North through seven South American countries.:  Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador,  Colombia and western Venezuela.\nAlong their length, the Andes are split into several ranges, separated by intermediate depressions. The Andes are the location of several high plateaus\u2014some of which host major cities such as Quito, Bogot\u00e1, Cali, Arequipa, Medell\u00edn, Bucaramanga, Sucre, M\u00e9rida, El Alto and La Paz. The Altiplano Plateau is the world's second-highest after the Tibetan Plateau. These ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate: the Tropical Andes, the Dry Andes, and the Wet Andes.\nThe Andes Mountains are the highest mountain range outside Asia. The highest mountain outside Asia, Argentina's Aconcagua, rises to an elevation of about 6,961 m (22,838 ft) above sea level. The peak of Chimborazo in the Ecuadorian Andes is farther from the Earth's center than any other location on the Earth's surface, due to the equatorial bulge resulting from the Earth's rotation. The world's highest volcanoes are in the Andes, including Ojos del Salado on the Chile-Argentina border, which rises to 6,893 m (22,615 ft).\nThe Andes are also part of the American Cordillera, a chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western \"backbone\" of the Americas and Antarctica.", "actual": "0", "rationale": "To evaluate the truth value of the statement \"mountain range(Loon Mountain, Andes)\" in the given hypothetical world, we need to determine whether Loon Mountain belongs to the Andes mountain range.", "predicted": "0"}, {"predicate": "mountain range", "arguments": "Prenj, M\u00fchlig-Hofmann Mountains", "world": "mountain range: range or subrange to which the geographical item belongs.

This barren and sparsely populated 'wilderness' has been referred to as the Desert of Wales. The area includes the sources of the River Severn and River Wye and was unsuccessfully proposed as a national park in the 1960s and 1970s.  The highest point of the range is Plynlimon, at 2,467 feet (752 m).\nThe wider, more historic, use of the term also includes Snowdonia in North Wales, and the Brecon Beacons and Black Mountains in South Wales.

In the northwest they join with the Ligurian Alps at Altare. In the southwest they end at Reggio di Calabria, the coastal city at the tip of the peninsula. Since 2000 the Environment Ministry of Italy, following the recommendations of the Apennines Park of Europe Project, has been defining the Apennines System to include the mountains of north Sicily, for a total distance of 1,500 kilometres (930 mi). The system forms an arc enclosing the east side of the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas.\nThe Apennines conserve some intact ecosystems that have survived human intervention. In these are some of the best preserved forests and montane grasslands in Europe, now protected by national parks and, within them, a high diversity of flora and fauna. These mountains are one of the last refuges of the big European predators such as the Italian wolf and the Marsican brown bear, now extinct in the rest of Central Europe.\nThe mountains lend their name to the Apennine peninsula that forms the major part of Italy. They are mostly verdant, although one side of the highest peak, Corno Grande, is partially covered by Calderone glacier, the only glacier in the Apennines. The eastern slopes down to the Adriatic Sea are steep, while the western slopes form foothills on which most of peninsular Italy's cities are located. The mountains tend to be named from the province or provinces in which they are located; for example, the Ligurian Apennines are in Liguria.", "actual": "0", "rationale": "To evaluate the truth value of the statement \"mountain range(Hatherton Glacier, Apennine Mountains)\" in the given hypothetical world, we need to determine if Hatherton Glacier belongs to the Apennine Mountains.", "predicted": "0"}, {"predicate": "mountain range", "arguments": "Maclaren Monolith, M\u00fchlig-Hofmann Mountains", "world": "mountain range: range or subrange to which the geographical item belongs.

High Atlas: The High Atlas, also called the Grand Atlas, is a mountain range in central Morocco, North Africa, the highest part of the Atlas Mountains.\nThe High Atlas rises in the west at the Atlantic Ocean and stretches in an eastern direction to the Moroccan-Algerian border. At the Atlantic and to the southwest the range drops abruptly and makes an impressive transition to the coast and the Anti-Atlas range. To the north, in the direction of Marrakech, the range descends less abruptly.\nThe range includes Jbel Toubkal, which at 4,167 m (2.589 mi; 13,671 ft) is the highest in the range and lies in Toubkal National Park.\nThe range serves as a weather system barrier in Morocco running east\u2013west and separating the Sahara from the Mediterranean and continental zones to the north and west. In the higher elevations of the massif, snow falls regularly, allowing winter sports. Snow lasts well into late spring in the High Atlas, mostly on the northern faces of the range. On the Western High Atlas, there is Ouka\u00efmeden, one of three main ski stations in Morocco.\nThe High Atlas forms the basins for a multiplicity of river systems. The majority of the year-round rivers flow to the north, providing the basis for the settlements there. A number of wadis and seasonal rivers terminate in the deserts to the south and plateaux to the east of the mountains.\nThe High-Atlas Mountains are inhabited by Berbers, who live from agriculture and pastoralism in the valleys. In the steppe zone of the High-Atlas, where precipitations are low, the locals created a smart technique in managing the low precipitations and the weak soil. They turn the rather semi-arid lands into fertile valleys called locally by Agdal (garden in Berber). This technique has intrigued many Western agriculturalists, in which they were impressed by the high efficiency of this agricultural system. Many scientists, particularly French scientists, make yearly expeditions to observe the community and their living system.", "actual": "0", "rationale": "To evaluate the truth value of the statement \"mountain range(Stauren Peak, High Atlas)\" in the given hypothetical world, we need to determine whether Stauren Peak belongs to the High Atlas mountain range.", "predicted": "0"}, {"predicate": "mountain range", "arguments": "Chastelhorn, Grampian Mountains", "world": "mountain range: range or subrange to which the geographical item belongs.

The northern flanks are covered by a glacier named St. Annafirn and a small lake (2,624 metres) lies south of the summit.\nThe massif of the Chastelhorn consists of several summits including the Gemsstock (2,961 metres) which is connected to Andermatt by a cable car. Grampian Mountains: The Grampian Mountains (Scottish Gaelic: Am Monadh) is one of the three major mountain ranges in Scotland, that together occupy about half of Scotland. The other two ranges are the Northwest Highlands and the Southern Uplands. The Grampian range extends southwest to northeast between the Highland Boundary Fault and the Great Glen. The range includes many of the highest mountains in the British Isles, including Ben Nevis (whose peak contains the highest point in the British Isles at 1,345 m or 4,413 ft above sea level) and Ben Macdui (whose peak contains second-highest at 1,309 m or 4,295 ft).\nA number of rivers and streams rise in the Grampians, including the Tay, Spey, Cowie Water, Burn of Muchalls, Burn of Pheppie, Burn of Elsick, Cairnie Burn, Don, Dee and Esk. The area is generally sparsely populated.\nThere is some ambiguity about the extent of the range, and until the nineteenth century, they were generally considered to be more than one range, which all formed part of the wider Scottish Highlands. This view is still held by many today, and they have no single name in the Scottish Gaelic language or the Doric dialect of Lowland Scots. In both languages, a number of names are used.
