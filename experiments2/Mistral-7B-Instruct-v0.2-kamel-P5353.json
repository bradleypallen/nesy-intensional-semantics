The Freshman Academy is a comprehensive freshman transition program for all first-time (or non-repeating) 9th graders. Each freshman is assigned to a Freshman Academy \"team,\" consisting of a counselor and four teachers and subjects: English, Honors Biology or Earth Science, World History, and Health & Physical Education. Each teaching team serves approximately 110\u2013120 common students\n.\nThe Academy was created as a response to a large number of freshman retentions as 100 to 150 freshmen were retained each year, at that time. A student could easily fall between the cracks when his/her stakeholders were not communicating regularly about the student\u2019s progress. During the 2003\u201304 school year, the staff began researching freshman academies across the state and the country. It was determined that the teaming concept used widely at the middle school level had merit on many levels and was the most practical way to address many of our transition needs. During the 2004\u201305 academic year, a pilot program was introduced including 40% of the Freshman class hand-selected for the program, expanding it full-scale in 2005\u201306. Since then the freshman academy has led to a significant decrease in retentions and has attracted students from all across Durham. During the 2013/2014 school year only 38 out of 413 students were retained.\nJordan has a rich tradition in athletics. The 2012/2013 athletic teams won seven conference championships (men's tennis, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's track and field, lacrosse, women\u2019s soccer, and wrestling).  The school also has a nationally recognized men\u2019s soccer program that has won 3 state titles.

During the 2013/2014 school year only 38 out of 413 students were retained.\nJordan has a rich tradition in athletics.
