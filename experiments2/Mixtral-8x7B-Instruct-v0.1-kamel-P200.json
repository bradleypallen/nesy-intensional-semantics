Lake Siskiyou: Lake Siskiyou is a reservoir formed by Box Canyon Dam on the Sacramento River, in far northern California, near the town of Mt. Shasta, California.  It is the site of local recreation, as well as being used for watershed protection and flood control. Sacramento River: The Sacramento River (Spanish: R\u00edo Sacramento) is the principal river of Northern California in the United States and is the largest river in California. Rising in the Klamath Mountains, the river flows south for 400 miles (640 km) before reaching the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta and San Francisco Bay. The river drains about 26,500 square miles (69,000 km2) in 19 California counties, mostly within the fertile agricultural region bounded by the Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada known as the Sacramento Valley, but also extending as far as the volcanic plateaus of Northeastern California. Historically, its watershed has reached as far north as south-central Oregon where the now, primarily, endorheic (closed) Goose Lake rarely experiences southerly outflow into the Pit River, the most northerly tributary of the Sacramento.\nThe Sacramento and its wide natural floodplain were once abundant in fish and other aquatic creatures, notably one of the southernmost large runs of chinook salmon in North America. For about 12,000 years, humans have depended on the vast natural resources of the watershed, which had one of the densest Native American populations in California. The river has provided a route for trade and travel since ancient times. Hundreds of tribes sharing regional customs and traditions have inhabited the Sacramento Valley, first coming into contact with European explorers in the late 1700s. The Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga named the river Rio de los Sacramentos in 1808, later shortened and anglicized into Sacramento.\nIn the 19th century, gold was discovered on a tributary of the Sacramento River, starting the California Gold Rush and an enormous population influx to the state. Overland trails such as the California Trail and Siskiyou Trail guided hundreds of thousands of people to the gold fields. By the late part of the century mining had ceased to be a major part of the economy, and many immigrants turned to farming and ranching. Many populous communities were established along the Sacramento River, including the state capital of Sacramento. Intensive agriculture and mining contributed to pollution in the Sacramento River, and significant changes to the river's hydrology and environment.\nSince the 1950s the watershed has been intensely developed for water supply and the generation of hydroelectric power. Today, large dams impound the river and almost all of its major tributaries. The Sacramento River is used heavily for irrigation and serves much of Central and Southern California through the canals of giant state and federal water projects. While it is now providing water to over half of California's population and supporting the most productive agricultural area in the nation, these changes have left the Sacramento greatly modified from its natural state and have caused the decline of its once-abundant fisheries.\n\n", "actual": "1", "rationale": "Lake Siskiyou is a reservoir formed by Box Canyon Dam on the Sacramento River, which means that the water in Lake Siskiyou comes from the Sacramento River.

The reservoir is largely surrounded by the Cheoah District of the Nantahala National Forest. During the last decades of the twentieth century non-public lands were developed as scenic residences and vacation homes, most notably in the area now incorporated as the town of Lake Santeetlah.\nAlthough the area below the highwater mark is now managed by Brookfield Energy Partners (BEP), which purchased the lake from Alcoa, approximately 80% of the surrounding land is under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service, which provides swimming, camping, picnicking, fishing and boating facilities.  Lake Santeetlah has 76 miles of shore line and is home to a variety of trout, muskie, crappie, and bass.

Fontana Lake: Fontana Lake is a reservoir impounded by Fontana Dam on the Little Tennessee River, and is located in Graham and Swain counties in North Carolina. The lake forms part of the southern border of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the northern border of part of the Nantahala National Forest. Depending on water levels, the lake is about 17 miles (27 km) long. The eastern end is the Tuckasegee River near Bryson City. It has an average depth of 135 feet (41 m) and reaches a maximum depth of 440 feet (130 m), making it the deepest lake in North Carolina. The lake has many inlets into coves and many islands formed from former mountain peaks, especially near the eastern end. As with most dam-impounded lakes, the steep banks are exposed when water levels are low. Many towns were submerged shortly after the creation of Fontana Lake, such as Proctor and Judson.\nFontana Lake provides the only access into the most remote areas of the National Park, unless visitors undertake a multi-day hike to get there. When the lake is at the normal summer level, a boat may be used to access remote trailheads such as Hazel Creek. From the observation tower on Clingmans Dome, on a clear day the lake can be seen nearly a mile below. While the maximum controlled elevation of the lake (top of dam gates) is 1,710 ft (520 m), the normal Summer surface elevation is 1,703 ft (519 m).

It flows east into Kansas and finally through Oklahoma and Arkansas, where it meets the Mississippi River.\nAt 1,469 miles (2,364 km), it is the sixth-longest river in the United States, the second-longest tributary in the Mississippi\u2013Missouri system, and the 45th longest river in the world. Its origin is in the Rocky Mountains in Lake County, Colorado, near Leadville. In 1859, placer gold discovered in the Leadville area brought thousands seeking to strike it rich, but the easily recovered placer gold was quickly exhausted. The Arkansas River's mouth is at Napoleon, Arkansas, and its drainage basin covers nearly 170,000 square miles (440,000 km2). Its volume is much smaller than the Missouri and Ohio rivers, with a mean discharge of about 40,000 cubic feet per second (1,100 m3/s).\nThe Arkansas from its headwaters to the 100th meridian west formed part of the U.S.\u2013Mexico border from the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty (in force 1821) until the Texas Annexation or Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.\n\n", "actual": "1", "rationale": "The statement inflows(Winthrop Rockefeller Lake, Arkansas River) is true because Winthrop Rockefeller Lake is an impounded section of the Arkansas River.

The flow of the two rivers is now regulated with a considerable portion of the South Saskatchewan diverted into the Qu'Appelle. Prior to the dams' construction, high water levels in the South Saskatchewan would frequently cause dangerous ice conditions downstream in Saskatoon while the Qu'Appelle would frequently dry up in the summer months.\nLake Diefenbaker provides water for domestic irrigation, drinking, and industrial uses. An extensive aqueduct (canal) system was built from the Gardiner Dam called the South Saskatchewan River Project. From the east-side of Gardiner Dam, the aqueduct system heads in a generally north-easterly direction ending at Dellwood Reservoir north-east of Little Manitou Lake in the RM of Usborne No. 310. Reservoirs along the course of the canal include Broderick Reservoir, Brightwater Reservoir, Indi Lake, Blackstrap Lake, Bradwell Reservoir, and Zelma Reservoir.\nLake Diefenbaker is the largest body of water in southern Saskatchewan, although Last Mountain Lake is the largest naturally occurring one. The lake was named after John G. Diefenbaker, a former Prime Minister of Canada. South Saskatchewan River: The South Saskatchewan River is a major river in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The river begins at the confluence of the Bow and Oldman Rivers in southern Alberta and ends at the Saskatchewan River Forks in central Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan River Forks is the confluence of the South and North Saskatchewan Rivers and is the beginning of the Saskatchewan River.\nFor the first half of the 20th century, the South Saskatchewan would completely freeze over during winter, creating spectacular ice breaks and dangerous conditions in Saskatoon, Medicine Hat, and elsewhere. At least one bridge in Saskatoon was destroyed by ice carried by the river. The construction of the Gardiner Dam in the 1960s, however, lessened the power of the river by diverting a substantial portion of the South Saskatchewan's natural flow into the Qu'Appelle River.

Bow River: The Bow River is a river in Alberta, Canada. It begins within the Canadian Rocky Mountains and winds through the Alberta foothills onto the prairies, where it meets the Oldman River, the two then forming the South Saskatchewan River.

Lake Umatilla: Lake Umatilla is a 110-mile (177 km) long  reservoir on the Columbia River in the United States, between the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon. It was created in 1971 with the construction of John Day Dam, and stretches upstream to the McNary Dam. It lies in parts of Sherman, Gilliam, Morrow, and Umatilla counties in Oregon, and Klickitat and Benton counties in Washington. Columbia River: The Columbia River (Upper Chinook: Wimahl or Wimal; Sahaptin: Nch\u2019i-W\u00e0na or Nchi wana; Sinixt dialect swah'netk'qhu) is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The river forms in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. It flows northwest and then south into the U.S. state of Washington, then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The river is 1,243 miles (2,000 kilometers) long, and its largest tributary is the Snake River. Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven states of the United States and one Canadian province. The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume, the Columbia has the greatest flow of any river entering the Pacific outside of Asia, and the 36th greatest discharge of any river in the world.\nThe Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region's culture and economy for thousands of years. They have been used for transportation since ancient times, linking the region's many cultural groups. The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish, which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline waters of the Pacific Ocean. These fish\u2014especially the salmon species\u2014provided the core subsistence for native peoples.\nThe first documented European discovery of the Columbia River occurred when Bruno de Heceta sighted the river's mouth in 1775.  On May 11, 1792, a private American ship, Columbia Rediviva, under Captain Robert Gray from Boston became the first non-indigenous vessel to enter the river.  Later in 1792, William Robert Broughton of the British Royal Navy commanding HMS Chatham as part of the Vancouver Expedition, navigated past the Oregon Coast Range and 100 miles (160 km) upriver to what is now Vancouver, Washington. In the following decades, fur-trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route. Overland explorers entered the Willamette Valley through the scenic, but treacherous Columbia River Gorge, and pioneers began to settle the valley in increasing numbers. Steamships along the river linked communities and facilitated trade; the arrival of railroads in the late 19th century, many running along the river, supplemented these links.\nSince the late 19th century, public and private sectors have extensively developed the river. To aid ship and barge navigation, locks have been built along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and dredging has opened, maintained, and enlarged  shipping channels. Since the early 20th century, dams have been built across the river for power generation, navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The 14 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia's main stem and many more on its tributaries produce more than 44 percent of total U.S. hydroelectric generation. Production of nuclear power has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced for decades at the Hanford Site, which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States. These developments have greatly altered river environments in the watershed, mainly through industrial pollution and barriers to fish migration.", "actual": "1", "rationale": "The Columbia River is the major inflow source for Lake Umatilla.", "predicted": "1"}, {"predicate": "inflows", "arguments": "Menindee Lakes, Darling River", "world": "inflows: major inflow sources \u2014 rivers, aquifers, glacial runoff, etc. Some terms may not be place names, e.g. none.

The Darling River is fed by nine major tributary river systems flowing from south-east Queensland and north and central NSW. The town of Menindee is close to the lakes and the nearest city is Broken Hill.\nThere are 4 main lakes in the system:\n\nLake Wetherell\nLake Pamamaroo\nLake Menindee (the largest lake, also known as Lake Minandichi)\nLake Cawndilla.\nThe lakes rely on replenishment, when water flows over the banks of the Darling (Barka) River. The NSW Government modified the lakes (completed 1968) to improve their storage capacity for farming, recreation, mining and urban water supply and to help manage floods in the Darling River. In the 1960s, governments decided to use some of the lakes as water storages, building a large weir (Main Weir) to divert water into lakes Pamamaroo, Tandure and Bijijie. Levees, block dams and channels were built to regulate the flow of water in the system. There is relatively little information on the flooding regimes of the lakes before they were regulated (dammed) in the 1960s but they were undoubtedly highly productive and important wetland systems where many fish were spawned.\nThe Menindee Lakes Water Storage Scheme supplies water to Broken Hill, the lower Darling and to water users along the Murray River in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia under the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement. Seven of the lakes have been incorporated in an artificially regulated overflow system providing both for flood mitigation and as storage for domestic use, livestock and irrigation downstream.  The lakes are also important for waterbirds.\nRecent research (Thoms and Delong 2018) found that the food webs have changed in a way that suggests that the ecological resilience of the system has declined.\nThe lakes were filled to capacity in 2021 with Lakes Cawndilla and Lake Menindee filling completely in early September meaning that the system was filled to over 98 per cent capacity with water flowing into Lake Speculation for the first time since 2012.

The Musconetcong River flows through the lake.\nLake Musconetcong was created by the building of the Lake Musconetcong Dam in the mid-19th century to provide an additional water source, then known as the Stanhope Reservoir, for the Morris Canal. The lake was deeded over to the State of New Jersey with the other parts of the Morris Canal System in 1924. Boating, fishing, and ice fishing are popular recreational activities on this lake.\nThe lake covers 329 acres (1.33 km2), with a mean depth of approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) and a maximum depth of 10 feet (3.0 m). The lake's watershed covers 14,000 acres (57 km2).

Musconetcong River: The Musconetcong River is a 45.7-mile-long (73.5 km) tributary of the Delaware River in northwestern New Jersey in the United States. It flows through the rural mountainous country of northwestern New Jersey. The name derives from the Lenape words moschakgeu meaning \"clear\" and hannek meaning \"stream\". Part of it is a National Wild and Scenic River.\n\nIt rises out of Lake Hopatcong, on the border between the borough of Hopatcong in Sussex County and the township of Roxbury in Morris County. It flows through Lake Musconetcong, then flows southwest, past Stephensburg and New Hampton, passing south of Washington then along the southeastern side of the Pohatcong Mountain ridge. It joins the Delaware at Riegelsville, approximately 10 mi (16 km) south of Phillipsburg.\nThe river does not flow through any large population center and has been the site of relatively little industrial development throughout its history. In the 18th century, the surrounding hills were largely deforested as a source of charcoal for the iron industry in the surrounding region. The local industry declined by the middle of the 19th century after the building of the former Morris Canal, the course of which ran along the upper river, to bring coal from Pennsylvania to northern New Jersey. After the demise of the canal from the introduction of railroads in the late 19th century, the dam pools along the river that supplied the canal became the site of a popular summer cottage industry. Silted remnants of the pools, as well as the remnants of the canal itself, can still be seen along the river.\nHuman habitation in the Musconetcong Valley can be traced back approximately 12,000 years to the end of the last ice age. The Plenge Site along the lower river in Warren County was the first of only two major Paleo-Indian archaeological site excavations in New Jersey, and is considered one of the most significant in the northeastern United States.\nThe USGS stream flow gauge at Bloomsbury has the river's flows recorded from as far back as 1904.  The average flow over the time recorded for the gauge at Bloomsbury is approximately 244 cfs.

The Detroit River has served an important role in the history of Detroit and Windsor, and is one of the world's busiest waterways. It is an important transportation route connecting Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior to Lake Erie and eventually to Lake Ontario, the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Erie Canal. When Detroit underwent rapid industrialization at the turn of the 20th century, the Detroit River became notoriously polluted and toxic. Since the late 20th century, however, a vast restoration effort has been undertaken because of the river's ecological importance.\nIn the early 21st century, the river today has a wide variety of economic and recreational uses.

The reservoir lies almost entirely in Douglas and Okanogan counties, although the dam itself lies partially in the easternmost portion of Chelan County. The reservoir stretches from there upstream to the Chief Joseph Dam. Towns on Lake Pateros include Pateros and Brewster, Washington.\nLake Pateros has been known by many variant names, including Butler Lake, Chief Long Jim Lake, Fort Okanogan Lake, Lake Azwell, and others. Columbia River: The Columbia River (Upper Chinook: Wimahl or Wimal; Sahaptin: Nch\u2019i-W\u00e0na or Nchi wana; Sinixt dialect swah'netk'qhu) is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The river forms in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. It flows northwest and then south into the U.S. state of Washington, then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The river is 1,243 miles (2,000 kilometers) long, and its largest tributary is the Snake River. Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven states of the United States and one Canadian province. The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume, the Columbia has the greatest flow of any river entering the Pacific outside of Asia, and the 36th greatest discharge of any river in the world.\nThe Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region's culture and economy for thousands of years. They have been used for transportation since ancient times, linking the region's many cultural groups. The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish, which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline waters of the Pacific Ocean. These fish\u2014especially the salmon species\u2014provided the core subsistence for native peoples.\nThe first documented European discovery of the Columbia River occurred when Bruno de Heceta sighted the river's mouth in 1775.  On May 11, 1792, a private American ship, Columbia Rediviva, under Captain Robert Gray from Boston became the first non-indigenous vessel to enter the river.  Later in 1792, William Robert Broughton of the British Royal Navy commanding HMS Chatham as part of the Vancouver Expedition, navigated past the Oregon Coast Range and 100 miles (160 km) upriver to what is now Vancouver, Washington. In the following decades, fur-trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route. Overland explorers entered the Willamette Valley through the scenic, but treacherous Columbia River Gorge, and pioneers began to settle the valley in increasing numbers. Steamships along the river linked communities and facilitated trade; the arrival of railroads in the late 19th century, many running along the river, supplemented these links.\nSince the late 19th century, public and private sectors have extensively developed the river. To aid ship and barge navigation, locks have been built along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and dredging has opened, maintained, and enlarged  shipping channels. Since the early 20th century, dams have been built across the river for power generation, navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The 14 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia's main stem and many more on its tributaries produce more than 44 percent of total U.S. hydroelectric generation. Production of nuclear power has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced for decades at the Hanford Site, which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States.

There are a number of islands in this lake, the largest being Aruro; others include Gidicho, Welege, Galmaka, and Alkali. The lake is red due to a high load of suspended sediments.\nThe lake is fed by three medium-sized rivers. First there is the  Bilate which rises on the southern slopes of Mount Gurage, then runs mostly southward to drain into Lake Abaya at its northern shore. Second, there is the Gidabo, which rises on the western slopes of the Bale Mountains, then also runs mostly southwards to drain into Lake Abaya at its northeastern tip after having passed the Gidabo flood plains. A third river is the Gelana, which rises at the western escarpment of the Rift Valley northwest of Bule Hora Town. Tributary streams also rise on the eastern and northern slopes of the Amaro Mountains. The Gelana then flows northwards through the Gelana Graben in the middle between both mountain ranges before it enters the Bore swamps and finally drains on the eastern side into the lake.\nThe only outflow of the lake is through the lower reaches of Kulfo River directly below an alluvial fan at an elevation of 1,190 m (at 6.0109\u00b0N 37.5854\u00b0E\ufeff / 6.0109; 37.5854). The riverbed acts as an spillway in the case of high lake levels and discharges the excess water into Lake Chamo. Usually, the lake level oscillates somewhat, in 2017 it was at 1,175 m, 15 m below the overflow level. In the last 50 years, the lake level oscillated only \u00b11.5 m around a mean value which is well below the overflow level. Consequently, the maximum depth of the lake changes only slightly from year to year, in the year 2002 the lake had a maximum depth of 13.1 meters.\nIn 1896 Lake Abaya was renamed \"Lake Margherita\" after the Queen Margherita of Savoy, wife of King Humbert I of Italy by the Italian explorer Vittorio Bottego who first explored the region. The name \"Lake Margherita\" (Lago Margherita) is still used in Italy.\n\n Bilate River: The Bilate is a river of south-central Ethiopia. It rises on the southwestern slopes of Mount Gurage near 6\u00b02\u2032N 38\u00b07\u2032E, flowing south along the western side of the Great Rift Valley, to empty into Lake Abaya at 6\u00b037\u203254\u2033N 37\u00b059\u20326\u2033E. It is the longest river flowing into Lake Abaya and also the one with the highest discharge. The 250 km long river is not navigable and has no notable tributaries. Along the middle of its course, the Bilate flows past the Bilate River volcanic field and its most territory covered by Halaba Zone.\nDavid Buxton recorded its importance as defining the boundary between the Sidamo district on the eastern side, and the Wolaita district on the western; he also described finding a weekly market beside a ford named Dinto.", "actual": "1", "rationale": "The statement inflows(Lake Abaya, Bilate River) is true because the Bilate River is one of the three medium-sized rivers that flow into Lake Abaya.", "predicted": "1"}, {"predicate": "inflows", "arguments": "Aliceville Lake, Tennessee\u2013Tombigbee Waterway", "world": "inflows: major inflow sources \u2014 rivers, aquifers, glacial runoff, etc. Some terms may not be place names, e.g. none.

Also, Red Top Mountain State Park is located on its shores, on the peninsula between the two arms of the lake. Most of the north side of the lake remains protected from land development because of its isolated location, mostly blocked by the lake.\nThe major highways Interstate 75 and U.S. Highway 41 pass along the southern and western sided of Lake Allatoona, and they cross the Etowah River downstream from the Allatoona Dam. Etowah River: The  Etowah River is a 164-mile-long (264 km) waterway that rises northwest of Dahlonega, Georgia, north of Atlanta. On Matthew Carey's 1795 map the river was labeled \"High Town River\". On later maps, such as the 1839 Cass County map (Cass being the original name for Bartow County), it was referred to as \"Hightower River\", a name that was used in most early Cherokee records.\nThe large Amicalola Creek (which flows over Amicalola Falls) is a primary tributary near the beginning of the river. The Etowah then flows west-southwest through Canton, Georgia, and soon forms Lake Allatoona. From the dam at the lake, it passes Cartersville and the Etowah Indian Mounds archaeological site. It then flows to Rome, Georgia, where it meets the Oostanaula River and forms the Coosa River at their confluence.  The river is the northernmost portion of the Etowah-Coosa-Alabama-Mobile Waterway, stretching from the mountains of north Georgia to Mobile Bay in Alabama.\nThe Little River is the largest tributary of the Etowah, their confluence now flooded by Lake Allatoona.  Allatoona Creek is another major tributary, flowing north from Cobb County and forming the other major arm of the lake.\nThe U.S. Board on Geographic Names officially named the river in 1897.\nThe river ends at 571 feet (174 m) above mean sea level.\nThe river is home to the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter, which are listed on the Endangered Species List.\nCountry singer-songwriter Jerry Reed made the Etowah the home of the wild, misunderstood swamp dweller Ko-Ko Joe in the 1971 song \"Ko-Ko Joe\".

Lake Jesup: Lake Jesup is the largest lake in Seminole County, Florida, United States and is one of many that make up the St. Johns River. Located along the middle basin of the St. Johns, the lake encompasses an area of approximately 16,000 acres (65 km2), including open water and floodplain. It is named in honor of Brigadier General Thomas Jesup, an American military officer who served in the Second Seminole War. The lake is bisected by one of the state's longest free-standing bridges, part of the Seminole County Expressway (SR 417).\nThe lake is home to a wide variety of species and is considered to support one of the state's densest populations of alligators. Drivers on the bridge across the lake are likely to see eagles (osprey and bald eagles) perched on the light posts watching for fish.\nDuring the 1960s, the toll of decades of abuse and neglect was very apparent. Wastewater discharged directly into the lake, stormwater discharges from surrounding communities, the construction of berms that segregated the lake from parts of its floodplain, and a causeway that reduced the lake's connection with the St. Johns River all took their toll on the ecosystem.  The discharges resulted in significant algae growth, fish kills, and a thick layer of muck more than 9\u00bd feet deep in some areas sitting on the bottom of the lake that now averages only six feet in depth. The berm construction aggravated this problem by limiting the lake's ability to cleanse itself.\nDuring the 1990s studies were conducted of water circulation patterns, storm-water runoff into the lake, the impacts of the State Road 417 bridge, sediments within the lake, and land management plans for adjacent public properties. With this data in hand, The Friends of Lake Jesup and the St. Johns River Water Management District staff worked closely with the Florida Department of Transportation and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to develop a plan for restoring the lake.\nThe Friends and the District staff, working closely with the Florida Department of Transportation and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, began to determine the most environmentally sound and economically feasible methods of restoring the lake.\nSince that time the water district brought about 3,850 acres (15.6 km2) around the lake into public ownership and has plans for acquiring an additional 4,700 acres (19 km2) of floodplain around the lake as part of the restoration process and to ensure the health of the lake into the future.\nIn the spring of 1996 a 2-mile (3.2 km) berm on the north side of the lake was removed, reuniting 300 acres (1.2 km2) of floodplain with the lake to act as a natural filter. The removal of this berm also increases the lake's flood buffering capacity as well as providing habitat to a wide variety of life.\nIn January 2008 the Army Corps of Engineers, the Florida Department of Transportation, and others contracted to have the State Road 417 bridge rebuilt.  The re-opening of channel B and the removal of about a mile of causeway was designed to improve the flow of the St. Johns River into and out of the lake.  Several other projects were also undertaken to improve the quality of the lake.  The Friends of Lake Jesup was active in monitoring these projects and in bringing new areas of concern into focus.  There are small businesses that operate lakeside restaurants, fish camps, and airboat tours in the vicinity of the lake. St. Johns River: The St. Johns River (Spanish: R\u00edo San Juan) is the longest river in the U.S. state of Florida and it is the most significant one for commercial and recreational use. At 310 miles (500 km) long, it flows north and winds through or borders twelve counties. The drop in elevation from headwaters to mouth is less than 30 feet (9 m); like most Florida waterways, the St. Johns has a very slow flow speed of 0.3 mph (0.13 m/s), and is often described as \"lazy\".\nNumerous lakes are formed by the river or flow into it, but as a river its widest point is nearly 3 miles (5 km) across. The narrowest point is in the headwaters, an unnavigable marsh in Indian River County. The St. Johns drainage basin of 8,840 square miles (22,900 km2) includes some of Florida's major wetlands. It is separated into three major basins and two associated watersheds for Lake George and the Ocklawaha River, all managed by the St. Johns River Water Management District.\nAlthough Florida was the location of the first permanent European settlement in what would become the United States, much of Florida remained an undeveloped frontier into the 20th century. With the growth of population, the St. Johns, like many Florida rivers, was altered to make way for agricultural and residential centers, suffering severe pollution and redirection that has diminished its ecosystem. The St. Johns, named one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998, was number 6 on a list of America's Ten Most Endangered Rivers in 2008. Restoration efforts are underway for the basins around the St. Johns as Florida's population continues to increase.\nHistorically, a variety of people have lived on or near the St. Johns, including Paleo-indians, Archaic people, Timucua, Mocama, Mayaca, Ais, French, Spanish, and British colonists, Seminoles, slaves and freemen, Florida crackers, land developers, tourists and retirees.

Lake Jesup: Lake Jesup is the largest lake in Seminole County, Florida, United States and is one of many that make up the St. Johns River. Located along the middle basin of the St. Johns, the lake encompasses an area of approximately 16,000 acres (65 km2), including open water and floodplain. It is named in honor of Brigadier General Thomas Jesup, an American military officer who served in the Second Seminole War. The lake is bisected by one of the state's longest free-standing bridges, part of the Seminole County Expressway (SR 417).\nThe lake is home to a wide variety of species and is considered to support one of the state's densest populations of alligators. Drivers on the bridge across the lake are likely to see eagles (osprey and bald eagles) perched on the light posts watching for fish.\nDuring the 1960s, the toll of decades of abuse and neglect was very apparent. Wastewater discharged directly into the lake, stormwater discharges from surrounding communities, the construction of berms that segregated the lake from parts of its floodplain, and a causeway that reduced the lake's connection with the St. Johns River all took their toll on the ecosystem.  The discharges resulted in significant algae growth, fish kills, and a thick layer of muck more than 9\u00bd feet deep in some areas sitting on the bottom of the lake that now averages only six feet in depth. The berm construction aggravated this problem by limiting the lake's ability to cleanse itself.\nDuring the 1990s studies were conducted of water circulation patterns, storm-water runoff into the lake, the impacts of the State Road 417 bridge, sediments within the lake, and land management plans for adjacent public properties. With this data in hand, The Friends of Lake Jesup and the St. Johns River Water Management District staff worked closely with the Florida Department of Transportation and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to develop a plan for restoring the lake.\nThe Friends and the District staff, working closely with the Florida Department of Transportation and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, began to determine the most environmentally sound and economically feasible methods of restoring the lake.\nSince that time the water district brought about 3,850 acres (15.6 km2) around the lake into public ownership and has plans for acquiring an additional 4,700 acres (19 km2) of floodplain around the lake as part of the restoration process and to ensure the health of the lake into the future.\nIn the spring of 1996 a 2-mile (3.2 km) berm on the north side of the lake was removed, reuniting 300 acres (1.2 km2) of floodplain with the lake to act as a natural filter. The removal of this berm also increases the lake's flood buffering capacity as well as providing habitat to a wide variety of life.\nIn January 2008 the Army Corps of Engineers, the Florida Department of Transportation, and others contracted to have the State Road 417 bridge rebuilt.  The re-opening of channel B and the removal of about a mile of causeway was designed to improve the flow of the St. Johns River into and out of the lake.  Several other projects were also undertaken to improve the quality of the lake.  The Friends of Lake Jesup was active in monitoring these projects and in bringing new areas of concern into focus.  There are small businesses that operate lakeside restaurants, fish camps, and airboat tours in the vicinity of the lake.

The original lake surface was 1,530 feet (466 m) above sea level, but when the river was dammed in 1900, the elevation was raised to 1,560 feet (475 m). Chester Morse Lake is more than four miles (6 km) long, and is primarily fed from the east by the north and south forks of the Cedar River, and from the south by the Rex River. The lake is part of the Seattle area water supply.\nLocated in the upper watershed, Chester Morse Lake is impounded by the masonry dam and a secondary control structure called the Overflow Dike. The lake now functions as a water supply storage reservoir and powers a 30-megawatt hydroelectric facility.\nChester Morse Lake was previously a natural lake called Cedar Lake. Cedar Lake was formed about 14,000 years ago by the terminal moraine of an alpine glacier descending the Cedar River valley from the upper elevations of the Cascade Mountains.\nBecause upstream fish passage to Chester Morse Lake is naturally blocked by Cedar Falls, the fish populations in the lake are isolated from those downstream. Bull trout and pygmy whitefish populations in Chester Morse Lake have thus been separated from other populations for at least 13,000 years, and represent unique genetic stocks of these species.\nBoth of these species spend most of their time in deeper portions of the lake.\nThe surface of Chester Morse Lake has an average annual fluctuation of about 20 feet in elevation. Inundation of the Cedar and Rex river deltas strongly affects their aquatic and wetland habitats.\nChanges in lake level management toward higher lake levels in the past 15 years have resulted in a retreat upslope of sedge and willow communities on the delta. Inundation of the Cedar and Rex river channels within and upstream of the delta causes sedimentation that can negatively affect bull trout eggs. Studies are underway to examine these effects.

Lake Jesup: Lake Jesup is the largest lake in Seminole County, Florida, United States and is one of many that make up the St. Johns River. Located along the middle basin of the St. Johns, the lake encompasses an area of approximately 16,000 acres (65 km2), including open water and floodplain. It is named in honor of Brigadier General Thomas Jesup, an American military officer who served in the Second Seminole War. The lake is bisected by one of the state's longest free-standing bridges, part of the Seminole County Expressway (SR 417).\nThe lake is home to a wide variety of species and is considered to support one of the state's densest populations of alligators. Drivers on the bridge across the lake are likely to see eagles (osprey and bald eagles) perched on the light posts watching for fish.\nDuring the 1960s, the toll of decades of abuse and neglect was very apparent. Wastewater discharged directly into the lake, stormwater discharges from surrounding communities, the construction of berms that segregated the lake from parts of its floodplain, and a causeway that reduced the lake's connection with the St. Johns River all took their toll on the ecosystem.  The discharges resulted in significant algae growth, fish kills, and a thick layer of muck more than 9\u00bd feet deep in some areas sitting on the bottom of the lake that now averages only six feet in depth. The berm construction aggravated this problem by limiting the lake's ability to cleanse itself.\nDuring the 1990s studies were conducted of water circulation patterns, storm-water runoff into the lake, the impacts of the State Road 417 bridge, sediments within the lake, and land management plans for adjacent public properties. With this data in hand, The Friends of Lake Jesup and the St. Johns River Water Management District staff worked closely with the Florida Department of Transportation and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to develop a plan for restoring the lake.\nThe Friends and the District staff, working closely with the Florida Department of Transportation and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, began to determine the most environmentally sound and economically feasible methods of restoring the lake.\nSince that time the water district brought about 3,850 acres (15.6 km2) around the lake into public ownership and has plans for acquiring an additional 4,700 acres (19 km2) of floodplain around the lake as part of the restoration process and to ensure the health of the lake into the future.\nIn the spring of 1996 a 2-mile (3.2 km) berm on the north side of the lake was removed, reuniting 300 acres (1.2 km2) of floodplain with the lake to act as a natural filter. The removal of this berm also increases the lake's flood buffering capacity as well as providing habitat to a wide variety of life.\nIn January 2008 the Army Corps of Engineers, the Florida Department of Transportation, and others contracted to have the State Road 417 bridge rebuilt.  The re-opening of channel B and the removal of about a mile of causeway was designed to improve the flow of the St. Johns River into and out of the lake.  Several other projects were also undertaken to improve the quality of the lake.  The Friends of Lake Jesup was active in monitoring these projects and in bringing new areas of concern into focus.  There are small businesses that operate lakeside restaurants, fish camps, and airboat tours in the vicinity of the lake.

The stream was originally known as the \"East Fork Coast Fork\", but was later renamed after a dispute (row) between neighbors and brothers-in-law George Clark and Joseph Southwell over \"trespassing\" livestock. Clark was killed as a result of the row. The name rhymes with \"cow\" rather than with \"slow\". A post office named Row River operated from 1911 to 1914 a little north of the present site of Dorena at 43.740123\u00b0N 122.880347\u00b0W\ufeff / 43.740123; -122.880347.\n\n", "actual": "0", "rationale": "The statement inflows(McIndoes Reservoir, Row River) is false because McIndoes Reservoir is located in northern New England on the Connecticut River, while the Row River is in Lane County, Oregon, United States.

The dam was built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The lake's capacity is 2,447,650 acre\u22c5ft (3,019.13 GL), making it one of the largest reservoirs in California. The lake's surface is at 2,370 ft (720 m) above MSL. Trinity Lake captures and stores water for the Central Valley Project, which provides the Central Valley with water for irrigation and produces hydroelectric power. This lake is known for its many small arms, glassy inlets, and good water-skiing conditions.\nAfter the death in office of California United States Senator Clair Engle in 1964, the lake was renamed after him. The name change never received wide popularity and the name was returned to the original name.\nThe lake is serviced by three marinas: Trinity Alps Marina located on the southern end in view of the Dam; Cedar Stock marina on the Stuart Fork arm on the west end of the lake; and Trinity Center marina at the northern end of the main arm of the lake.

The nearest community is Bourkes, 10.9 kilometres (6.8 mi) to the northeast.\nThe lake is about 1,170 metres (3,840 ft) long and 270 metres (890 ft) wide. The primary inflow, at the west, is Tomwool Creek arriving from Arras Lake. There are secondary inflows at the west and east. The primary outflow, at the south, is also Tomwool Creek, which heads south. Tomwwool Creek flows via Sarsfield Creek, Meyers Lake, Woollings Creek, the Whiteclay River, the Black River, the Abitibi River and the Moose River to James Bay.\n\n Tennessee\u2013Tombigbee Waterway: The Tennessee\u2013Tombigbee Waterway (popularly known as the Tenn-Tom) is a 234-mile (377 km) artificial U.S. waterway built in the 20th century from the Tennessee River to the junction of the Black Warrior-Tombigbee River system near Demopolis, Alabama. The Tennessee\u2013Tombigbee Waterway links commercial navigation from the nation's midsection to the Gulf of Mexico. The major features of the waterway are 234 miles (377 km) of navigation channels, a 175-foot-deep (53 m) cut between the watersheds of the Tombigbee and Tennessee rivers, and ten locks and dams. \nThe locks are 9 by 110 by 600 feet (2.7 m \u00d7 33.5 m \u00d7 182.9 m), the same dimension as those on the Mississippi above Lock and Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois.\nUnder construction for 12 years by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Tennessee\u2013Tombigbee Waterway was completed in December 1984 at a total cost of nearly $2 billion.\nThe Tenn-Tom encompasses 17 public ports and terminals, 110,000 acres (450 km2) of land, and another 88,000 acres (360 km2) managed by state conservation agencies for wildlife habitat preservation and recreational use.\n\n", "actual": "0", "rationale": "The statement inflows(Tomwool Lake, Tennessee\u2013Tombigbee Waterway) is asking if Tomwool Lake is a source of inflow for the Tennessee\u2013Tombigbee Waterway.

Lake Jesup: Lake Jesup is the largest lake in Seminole County, Florida, United States and is one of many that make up the St. Johns River. Located along the middle basin of the St. Johns, the lake encompasses an area of approximately 16,000 acres (65 km2), including open water and floodplain. It is named in honor of Brigadier General Thomas Jesup, an American military officer who served in the Second Seminole War. The lake is bisected by one of the state's longest free-standing bridges, part of the Seminole County Expressway (SR 417).\nThe lake is home to a wide variety of species and is considered to support one of the state's densest populations of alligators. Drivers on the bridge across the lake are likely to see eagles (osprey and bald eagles) perched on the light posts watching for fish.\nDuring the 1960s, the toll of decades of abuse and neglect was very apparent. Wastewater discharged directly into the lake, stormwater discharges from surrounding communities, the construction of berms that segregated the lake from parts of its floodplain, and a causeway that reduced the lake's connection with the St. Johns River all took their toll on the ecosystem.  The discharges resulted in significant algae growth, fish kills, and a thick layer of muck more than 9\u00bd feet deep in some areas sitting on the bottom of the lake that now averages only six feet in depth. The berm construction aggravated this problem by limiting the lake's ability to cleanse itself.\nDuring the 1990s studies were conducted of water circulation patterns, storm-water runoff into the lake, the impacts of the State Road 417 bridge, sediments within the lake, and land management plans for adjacent public properties. With this data in hand, The Friends of Lake Jesup and the St. Johns River Water Management District staff worked closely with the Florida Department of Transportation and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to develop a plan for restoring the lake.\nThe Friends and the District staff, working closely with the Florida Department of Transportation and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, began to determine the most environmentally sound and economically feasible methods of restoring the lake.\nSince that time the water district brought about 3,850 acres (15.6 km2) around the lake into public ownership and has plans for acquiring an additional 4,700 acres (19 km2) of floodplain around the lake as part of the restoration process and to ensure the health of the lake into the future.\nIn the spring of 1996 a 2-mile (3.2 km) berm on the north side of the lake was removed, reuniting 300 acres (1.2 km2) of floodplain with the lake to act as a natural filter. The removal of this berm also increases the lake's flood buffering capacity as well as providing habitat to a wide variety of life.\nIn January 2008 the Army Corps of Engineers, the Florida Department of Transportation, and others contracted to have the State Road 417 bridge rebuilt.  The re-opening of channel B and the removal of about a mile of causeway was designed to improve the flow of the St. Johns River into and out of the lake.  Several other projects were also undertaken to improve the quality of the lake.  The Friends of Lake Jesup was active in monitoring these projects and in bringing new areas of concern into focus.  There are small businesses that operate lakeside restaurants, fish camps, and airboat tours in the vicinity of the lake. Raquette River: The Raquette River, sometimes spelled Racquette, originates at Raquette Lake in the Adirondack Mountains in the U.S. state of New York.  146 miles (235 km) long, it is the third longest river entirely in the state of New York.\nThe river is a popular destination for canoeing and kayaking. It passes through many natural and man-made lakes to its final destination at Akwesasne on the Saint Lawrence River. The river is the source of 27 hydroelectric plants operated by Brookfield Power, which at capacity can produce up to 181 megawatts of power.\nHistorically, the river was a part of the \"Highway of the Adirondacks\", by which it was possible to travel hundreds of miles by canoe or guideboat with short stretches of portage connecting various waterways.  This route is still followed by the Northern Forest Canoe Trail, a 740-mile (1,190 km) canoe trail from Old Forge to Fort Kent in Maine.  It is also the basis of the route of the Adirondack Canoe Classic, a three-day, 90-mile canoe race from Old Forge to Saranac Lake.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n", "actual": "0", "rationale": "The Raquette River is located in New York, while Lake Jesup is located in Florida.

Columbia River: The Columbia River (Upper Chinook: Wimahl or Wimal; Sahaptin: Nch\u2019i-W\u00e0na or Nchi wana; Sinixt dialect swah'netk'qhu) is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The river forms in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. It flows northwest and then south into the U.S. state of Washington, then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The river is 1,243 miles (2,000 kilometers) long, and its largest tributary is the Snake River. Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven states of the United States and one Canadian province. The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume, the Columbia has the greatest flow of any river entering the Pacific outside of Asia, and the 36th greatest discharge of any river in the world.\nThe Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region's culture and economy for thousands of years. They have been used for transportation since ancient times, linking the region's many cultural groups. The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish, which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline waters of the Pacific Ocean. These fish\u2014especially the salmon species\u2014provided the core subsistence for native peoples.\nThe first documented European discovery of the Columbia River occurred when Bruno de Heceta sighted the river's mouth in 1775.  On May 11, 1792, a private American ship, Columbia Rediviva, under Captain Robert Gray from Boston became the first non-indigenous vessel to enter the river.  Later in 1792, William Robert Broughton of the British Royal Navy commanding HMS Chatham as part of the Vancouver Expedition, navigated past the Oregon Coast Range and 100 miles (160 km) upriver to what is now Vancouver, Washington. In the following decades, fur-trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route. Overland explorers entered the Willamette Valley through the scenic, but treacherous Columbia River Gorge, and pioneers began to settle the valley in increasing numbers. Steamships along the river linked communities and facilitated trade; the arrival of railroads in the late 19th century, many running along the river, supplemented these links.\nSince the late 19th century, public and private sectors have extensively developed the river. To aid ship and barge navigation, locks have been built along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and dredging has opened, maintained, and enlarged  shipping channels. Since the early 20th century, dams have been built across the river for power generation, navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The 14 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia's main stem and many more on its tributaries produce more than 44 percent of total U.S. hydroelectric generation. Production of nuclear power has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced for decades at the Hanford Site, which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States.

The original lake surface was 1,530 feet (466 m) above sea level, but when the river was dammed in 1900, the elevation was raised to 1,560 feet (475 m). Chester Morse Lake is more than four miles (6 km) long, and is primarily fed from the east by the north and south forks of the Cedar River, and from the south by the Rex River. The lake is part of the Seattle area water supply.\nLocated in the upper watershed, Chester Morse Lake is impounded by the masonry dam and a secondary control structure called the Overflow Dike. The lake now functions as a water supply storage reservoir and powers a 30-megawatt hydroelectric facility.\nChester Morse Lake was previously a natural lake called Cedar Lake. Cedar Lake was formed about 14,000 years ago by the terminal moraine of an alpine glacier descending the Cedar River valley from the upper elevations of the Cascade Mountains.\nBecause upstream fish passage to Chester Morse Lake is naturally blocked by Cedar Falls, the fish populations in the lake are isolated from those downstream. Bull trout and pygmy whitefish populations in Chester Morse Lake have thus been separated from other populations for at least 13,000 years, and represent unique genetic stocks of these species.\nBoth of these species spend most of their time in deeper portions of the lake.\nThe surface of Chester Morse Lake has an average annual fluctuation of about 20 feet in elevation. Inundation of the Cedar and Rex river deltas strongly affects their aquatic and wetland habitats.\nChanges in lake level management toward higher lake levels in the past 15 years have resulted in a retreat upslope of sedge and willow communities on the delta. Inundation of the Cedar and Rex river channels within and upstream of the delta causes sedimentation that can negatively affect bull trout eggs. Studies are underway to examine these effects. Elwha River: The Elwha River is a 45-mile (72 km) river on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. From its source at Elwha snowfinger in the Olympic Mountains, it flows generally north to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Most of the river's course is within the Olympic National Park.\nThe Elwha is one of several rivers in the Pacific Northwest that hosts all five species of native Pacific salmon (chinook, coho, chum, sockeye, and pink salmon), plus four anadromous trout species (steelhead, coastal cutthroat trout, bull trout, and Dolly Varden char). From 1911 to 2014, dams blocked fish passage on the lower Elwha River. Before the dams, 400,000 adult salmon returned yearly to spawn in 70 miles (110 km) of river habitat. Prior to dam removal, fewer than 4,000 salmon returned each year in only 4.9 miles (7.9 km) of habitat below the lower dam.  The National Park Service removed the two dams as part of the $325 million Elwha Ecosystem Restoration Project. Dam removal work began in September 2011 and was completed in August 2014.

On later maps, such as the 1839 Cass County map (Cass being the original name for Bartow County), it was referred to as \"Hightower River\", a name that was used in most early Cherokee records.\nThe large Amicalola Creek (which flows over Amicalola Falls) is a primary tributary near the beginning of the river. The Etowah then flows west-southwest through Canton, Georgia, and soon forms Lake Allatoona. From the dam at the lake, it passes Cartersville and the Etowah Indian Mounds archaeological site.

Other towns and villages at the lake include Weesen, Quinten, Quarten, and Murg.\nThe three main rivers leading to the lake are the Seez, Murgbach, and Linth. The last continues its course from Walensee to Lake Zurich. The Schnittlauchinsel, at the eastern end of the lake, is the only island in the Walensee.\nThe Churfirsten range raises steeply on the north side from the lake's level at 419 m to 2,306 m above sea level. On the south, the lake is overlooked by the M\u00fcrtschenstock Massif, whose peak is 2,441 m above sea level.

Sacramento River: The Sacramento River (Spanish: R\u00edo Sacramento) is the principal river of Northern California in the United States and is the largest river in California. Rising in the Klamath Mountains, the river flows south for 400 miles (640 km) before reaching the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta and San Francisco Bay. The river drains about 26,500 square miles (69,000 km2) in 19 California counties, mostly within the fertile agricultural region bounded by the Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada known as the Sacramento Valley, but also extending as far as the volcanic plateaus of Northeastern California. Historically, its watershed has reached as far north as south-central Oregon where the now, primarily, endorheic (closed) Goose Lake rarely experiences southerly outflow into the Pit River, the most northerly tributary of the Sacramento.\nThe Sacramento and its wide natural floodplain were once abundant in fish and other aquatic creatures, notably one of the southernmost large runs of chinook salmon in North America. For about 12,000 years, humans have depended on the vast natural resources of the watershed, which had one of the densest Native American populations in California. The river has provided a route for trade and travel since ancient times. Hundreds of tribes sharing regional customs and traditions have inhabited the Sacramento Valley, first coming into contact with European explorers in the late 1700s. The Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga named the river Rio de los Sacramentos in 1808, later shortened and anglicized into Sacramento.\nIn the 19th century, gold was discovered on a tributary of the Sacramento River, starting the California Gold Rush and an enormous population influx to the state. Overland trails such as the California Trail and Siskiyou Trail guided hundreds of thousands of people to the gold fields. By the late part of the century mining had ceased to be a major part of the economy, and many immigrants turned to farming and ranching. Many populous communities were established along the Sacramento River, including the state capital of Sacramento. Intensive agriculture and mining contributed to pollution in the Sacramento River, and significant changes to the river's hydrology and environment.\nSince the 1950s the watershed has been intensely developed for water supply and the generation of hydroelectric power. Today, large dams impound the river and almost all of its major tributaries. The Sacramento River is used heavily for irrigation and serves much of Central and Southern California through the canals of giant state and federal water projects. While it is now providing water to over half of California's population and supporting the most productive agricultural area in the nation, these changes have left the Sacramento greatly modified from its natural state and have caused the decline of its once-abundant fisheries.\n\n", "actual": "0", "rationale": "The statement inflows(Walensee, Sacramento River) is comparing two different geographical locations, one being a lake in Switzerland and the other being a river in California.

It is a shallow drainage lake, fed by the R\u0113zekne, Malta, Malmuta and Lisi\u0146a rivers and several smaller brooks, with an outflow via the Aiviekste River into the Daugava River.\nAfter the damaging spring floods in 1926, several dams and ditches were constructed.

The reservoir stretches 129 kilometres (80 mi) from there to the dam in Zaporizhzhia, and has a width of 3.2 km, a maximum width of 7 km, an average depth of 8 meters, a maximum depth of 53 meters, and a volume of 3.3 km3.\nThe Dnieper, Kakhovka, Kaniv, Kamianske, Kremenchuk, and Kyiv reservoirs form the Dnieper reservoir cascade, a deep-water route on the Dnieper that allows ships to sail upstream as far as the Prypiat river. Hutchinson River: The Hutchinson River is a 10 mile-long (16 km) freshwater stream located in the New York City borough of the Bronx and Southern Westchester County, New York, United States. It forms on the New Rochelle\u2013Scarsdale municipal line off Brookline Road in the latter community and flows south, draining a 19.4-square-mile (50 km2) area. It continues to serve as New Rochelle's city line with Eastchester; further downstream; its lower reaches divide Mount Vernon and Pelham until it enters the Bronx and empties into Long Island Sound's Eastchester Bay.\nThe river is named for Anne Hutchinson, who came from Rhode Island in 1642 and settled on Pelham Neck to the east of the river, across from where Co-op City is now.\nMuch of the land in the Hutchinson's watershed has been extensively developed over the last century as the New York metropolitan area grew and suburbanized. Along all but its uppermost and lowermost stretches, it is paralleled by the Hutchinson River Parkway. At three points along its length it has been dammed to create reservoirs. Its lower three miles (5 km) are commercially navigable and still in use by shipping.\nAs a result of all this pressure, the river is seriously polluted. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation rates the entire stream as impaired to an extent that it cannot be used as drinking water or recreationally; local authorities discourage eating any fish caught from the Hutchinson. Efforts to clean up the river have begun both in the form of remediation programs and lawsuits against polluters.\n\n", "actual": "0", "rationale": "The Dnieper Reservoir is a reservoir in Ukraine, while the Hutchinson River is a river in New York City. They are not connected geographically, so it is not possible for there to be inflows from the Hutchinson River to the Dnieper Reservoir.", "predicted": "0"}]
