However, classification is still complicated due to similarities to the body of several other theropod dinosaurs, as well as the lack of unifying, diagnostic features that are shared by all compsognathids.

Megalonychidae: Megalonychidae is an extinct family of sloths including the extinct Megalonyx. Megalonychids first appeared in the early Oligocene, about 35 million years (Ma) ago, in southern Argentina (Patagonia). There is, however, one possible find dating to the Eocene, about 40 Ma ago, on Seymour Island in Antarctica (which was then still connected to South America).

It is the smallest rhinoceros, although it is still a large mammal; it stands 112\u2013145 cm (44\u201357 in) high at the shoulder, with a head-and-body length of 2.36\u20133.18 m (7 ft 9 in \u2013 10 ft 5 in) and a tail of 35\u201370 cm (14\u201328 in). The weight is reported to range from 500\u20131,000 kg (1,100\u20132,200 lb), averaging 700\u2013800 kg (1,540\u20131,760 lb). Like both African species, it has two horns; the larger is the nasal horn, typically 15\u201325 cm (5.9\u20139.8 in), while the other horn is typically a stub. A coat of reddish-brown hair covers most of the Sumatran rhino's body.\nThe Sumatran rhinoceros once inhabited rainforests, swamps and cloud forests in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan. It is now critically endangered, with only five substantial populations in the wild: four in Sumatra and one in Borneo, with an estimated total population of fewer than 80 mature individuals. The species was extirpated in Malaysia in 2019, and one of the Sumatran populations may already be extinct. In 2015, researchers announced that the Bornean rhinoceros had become extinct in the northern part of Borneo in Sabah, Malaysia. A tiny population was discovered in East Kalimantan in early 2016.The Sumatran rhino is a mostly solitary animal except for courtship and offspring-rearing. It is the most vocal rhino species and also communicates through marking soil with its feet, twisting saplings into patterns, and leaving excrement. The species is much better studied than the similarly reclusive Javan rhinoceros, in part because of a program that brought 40 Sumatran rhinos into captivity with the goal of preserving the species. There was little or no information about procedures that would assist in ex situ breeding. Though a number of rhinos died once at the various destinations and no offspring were produced for nearly 20 years, the rhinos were all doomed in their soon-to-be-logged forest. In March 2016, a Sumatran rhinoceros (of the Bornean rhinoceros subspecies) was spotted in Indonesian Borneo.The Indonesian ministry of Environment, began an official counting of the Sumatran rhino in February 2019, planned to be completed in three years.\nMalaysia's last known bull and cow Sumatran rhinos died in May and November 2019, respectively.

Viruses within this family have a similar morphology, with an icosahedral capsid (polyhedron with 20 faces). As of 2014, there were 33 species in this family, divided among 6 genera. This family belongs to a super-group of large viruses known as nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses. Evidence was published in 2014 suggesting that specific strains of Phycodnaviridae might infect humans rather than just algal species, as was previously believed. Most genera under this family enter the host cell by cell receptor endocytosis and replicate in the nucleus. Phycodnaviridae play important ecological roles by regulating the growth and productivity of their algal hosts. Algal species such Heterosigma akashiwo and the genus Chrysochromulina can form dense blooms which can be damaging to fisheries, resulting in losses in the aquaculture industry. Heterosigma akashiwo virus (HaV) has been suggested for use as a microbial agent to prevent the recurrence of toxic red tides produced by this algal species. Phycodnaviridae cause death and lysis of freshwater and marine algal species, liberating organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus into the water, providing nutrients for the microbial loop.\n\n", "actual": "1", "rationale": "The statement \"parent taxon(Coccolithovirus, Phycodnaviridae)\" is true if Coccolithovirus is a genus within the family Phycodnaviridae.", "predicted": "1"}, {"predicate": "parent taxon", "arguments": "Serikornis, Paraves", "world": "parent taxon: closest parent taxon of the taxon in question.Serikornis: Serikornis is a genus of small, feathered anchiornithid dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning, China.

It includes all parasitic flatworms (clade Neodermata) and most free-living species that were previously grouped in the now obsolete class Turbellaria. Therefore, it contains the majority of the species in the phylum Platyhelminthes, excluding only the catenulids, to which they appear to be the sister group.\nThe clade Rhabditophora was originally erected by Ulrich Ehlers in 1985 based on morphological analyses and its monophyly was later confirmed by molecular studies.\n\n Platyhelminthes: The flatworms, flat worms, Platyhelminthes, or platyhelminths (from the Greek \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd, platy, meaning \"flat\" and \u1f15\u03bb\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03c2 (root: \u1f11\u03bb\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8-), helminth-, meaning \"worm\") are a phylum of relatively simple bilaterian, unsegmented, soft-bodied invertebrates. Unlike other bilaterians, they are acoelomates (having no body cavity), and have no specialised circulatory and respiratory organs, which restricts them to having flattened shapes that allow oxygen and nutrients to pass through their bodies by diffusion. The digestive cavity has only one opening for both ingestion (intake of nutrients) and egestion (removal of undigested wastes); as a result, the food cannot be processed continuously.\nIn traditional medicinal texts, Platyhelminthes are divided into Turbellaria, which are mostly non-parasitic animals such as planarians, and three entirely parasitic groups: Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea; however, since the turbellarians have since been proven not to be monophyletic, this classification is now deprecated. Free-living flatworms are mostly predators, and live in water or in shaded, humid terrestrial environments, such as leaf litter. Cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes) have complex life-cycles, with mature stages that live as parasites in the digestive systems of fish or land vertebrates, and intermediate stages that infest secondary hosts. The eggs of trematodes are excreted from their main hosts, whereas adult cestodes generate vast numbers of hermaphroditic, segment-like proglottids that detach when mature, are excreted, and then release eggs. Unlike the other parasitic groups, the monogeneans are external parasites infesting aquatic animals, and their larvae metamorphose into the adult form after attaching to a suitable host.\nBecause they do not have internal body cavities, Platyhelminthes were regarded as a primitive stage in the evolution of bilaterians (animals with bilateral symmetry and hence with distinct front and rear ends). However, analyses since the mid-1980s have separated out one subgroup, the Acoelomorpha, as basal bilaterians \u2013 closer to the original bilaterians than to any other modern groups. The remaining Platyhelminthes form a monophyletic group, one that contains all and only descendants of a common ancestor that is itself a member of the group. The redefined Platyhelminthes is part of the Lophotrochozoa, one of the three main groups of more complex bilaterians. These analyses had concluded the redefined Platyhelminthes, excluding Acoelomorpha, consists of two monophyletic subgroups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, with Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea forming a monophyletic subgroup within one branch of the Rhabditophora.

Septal necks are orthochoanitic ventrally and orthochoanitic or cyrtochoanitic dorsally.The Aipoceratoidea are the Solenochilida according to Flower and are the Solenocheilaceae which Shimansky included in his Rutoceratina minus the Litogyroceratidae which the Treatise includes in the Rutoceratidae (Tainocerataceae)\nThe Aipoceratoidea include three families and at least nine genera. The families are the Aipoceratidae Hyatt 1883, Solenochilidae Hyatt 1893, and Scyphoceratidae Ruzhentsev & Shimansky 1954.\nThe  Aipoceratidae are represented by the loosely coiled, compressed and gyroconic Aipoceras from the Lower Carboniferous (Miss) of Europe and North America; the Solenochilidae by the tightly coiled cosmopolitan Solenochilis from the Upper Carboniferous (Penn)- Lower Permian, with  spines projecting straight out laterally from the umbilical region; Scyphoceratidae by Scyphoceras from the Lower Permian of the Urals which has a ribbed shell and a relatively small and sharply curved phragmocone. \nThe derivation of the Aipoceratoidea is somewhat tenuous.  Kummel (1964, K385 fig. 280) shows a tentative connection to the Rutoceratidae in the Devonian. Flower also shows a tentative connection but from the equivalent Solenochilida to the Barrndeocerida.

The dentition is similar in morphology between the two groups, with the exception of the deciduous lower third premolar varying from one genus to the next.

The Marmosops are also commonly confused with the genus Gracilinanus, but this is quickly ruled out by a large number of differing characteristics. These differences include the arrangement of their digits, caudal (anatomical term) scales, and the central hair on the scales changing from a three hairs per follicle to many more.
