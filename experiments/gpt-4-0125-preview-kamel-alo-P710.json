If Radomiak Radom was one of the football teams competing in the Ekstraklasa during the 1984\u201385 season, then the statement would be true. Without specific historical data on the 1984\u201385 Ekstraklasa season within this hypothetical scenario, we would rely on the premise provided. If Radomiak Radom did compete in that season, they would qualify as a participant under the given definition.\n\nAnswer: Without access to specific historical records in this hypothetical scenario and based solely on the logical structure provided, I cannot definitively conclude the truth value of the statement without assuming external knowledge. However, the process to determine the truth value involves verifying Radomiak Radom's participation in the 1984\u201385 Ekstraklasa season.
