Sussex: Sussex (/\u02c8s\u028cs\u026aks/; from the Old English S\u016b\u00fes\u0113axe; lit.\u2009'South Saxons') is an area and cultural region within South East England which was historically a kingdom and later a county. It includes the ceremonial counties of East Sussex and West Sussex. \nThe kingdom of Sussex emerged in the 5th century from the Roman canton of the Regni and the Iron Age tribal region that preceded it. In about 827, shortly after the Battle of Ellendun, Sussex was conquered by Wessex. From 860 it was ruled by the kings of Wessex and by 927 it was joined by the remaining Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to form the kingdom of England. By the Norman period Sussex was subdivided into administrative districts known as rapes, which were themselves divided into hundreds. By the sixteenth century the eastern three rapes and the western three rapes were combined for most of the meetings of the court of quarter sessions. This arrangement was maintained when administrative counties and independent county boroughs were established in 1889. In Sussex this led to the creation of East Sussex County Council and West Sussex County Council to govern smaller towns and rural areas, while the larger towns were made county boroughs independent of the county councils. \nThe basic division of Sussex into east and west for the purposes of administration continued in subsequent local government reform. The Lord Lieutenant and Sheriff of Sussex were replaced in 1974 with separate posts for East and West Sussex, with Sussex losing its status as a ceremonial county.\nSussex is bordered by Surrey to the north, Kent to the north-east, the English Channel to the south, and Hampshire to the west. Two-thirds of the population live along its 220 kilometres (137 mi) of coastline or in the Brighton-Gatwick corridor. This includes the city of Brighton and Hove and its wider city region. The rest of the area is sparsely populated and includes large parts of the South Downs National Park and the National Landscapes of the High Weald and Chichester Harbour.\nSussex is recognised as a single cultural region, significant in culture and sport and is used by a range of organisations as a regional unit.

The current church building was built in the 11th century by the Normans, with portions being rebuilt in the 13th and 15th centuries. The church building is one of the oldest and best-known parish churches in Wales. It is a grade I listed building, or building of exceptional interest, and has been called both the \"Westminster Abbey of Wales\"  for its unique collection of carved stones and effigies, and \"the most beautiful church in Wales.\"The parish is currently part of the Rectorial Benefice of Llantwit Major in the Diocese of Llandaff.

Originally an early medieval petty kingdom of varying boundaries known in Welsh as Morgannwg (or Glywysing), which was then invaded and taken over by the Normans as the Lordship of Glamorgan. The area that became known as Glamorgan was both a rural, pastoral area, and a conflict point between the Norman lords and the Welsh princes. It was defined by a large concentration of castles.\nAfter falling under English rule in the 16th century, Glamorgan became a more stable county, and exploited its natural resources to become an important part of the Industrial Revolution. Glamorgan was the most populous and industrialised county in Wales, and was once called the \"crucible of the Industrial Revolution\", as it contained the world centres of three metallurgical industries (iron, steel and copper) and its rich resources of coal.\nUnder the Local Government Act 1972, the county boroughs and administrative county of Glamorgan were abolished on 1 April 1974, with three new counties being established, each containing a former county borough: West Glamorgan, Mid Glamorgan, South Glamorgan. The name also survives in that of Vale of Glamorgan, a county borough.\nGlamorgan comprised distinct regions: the industrial valleys, the agricultural vale and the scenic Gower Peninsula. The county had boundaries with Brecknockshire (north), Monmouthshire (east), Carmarthenshire (west), and to the south it was bordered by the Bristol Channel. The total area was 2,100 km2 (811 sq mi). Glamorgan contained two cities, Cardiff, the county town and from 1955 the capital city of Wales, and Swansea.

Sutherland: Sutherland (Scottish Gaelic: Cataibh) is a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area in the Highlands of Scotland. Its county town is Dornoch. Sutherland borders Caithness and Moray Firth to the east, Ross-shire and Cromartyshire (later combined into Ross and Cromarty) to the south and the Atlantic to the north and west. Like its southern neighbour Ross-shire, Sutherland has some of the most dramatic scenery in Europe, especially on its western fringe where the mountains meet the sea. These include high sea cliffs and very old mountains composed of Precambrian and Cambrian rocks.\nThe name Sutherland dates from the period of Norwegian Viking rule and settlement over much of the Highlands and Islands, under the rule of the jarl of Orkney. Although it contains some of the northernmost land in the island of Great Britain, it was called Su\u00f0rland (\"southern land\") from the standpoint of Orkney and Caithness. In Gaelic, the area is referred to according to its traditional areas: D\u00f9thaich MhicAoidh (or D\u00f9thaich 'IcAoidh) (MacAoidh's country) in the northeast, Asainte (Assynt) in the west, and Cataibh in the east. Cataibh is also sometimes used to refer to the area as a whole. The northeast corner of Sutherland, traditionally known as the Province of Strathnaver, was not incorporated into Sutherland until 1601. This was the home of the powerful and warlike Clan Mackay, and as such was named in Gaelic, D\u00f9thaich 'Ic Aoidh, the Homeland of Mackay. Even today this part of Sutherland is known as Mackay Country, and, unlike other areas of Scotland where the names traditionally associated with the area have become diluted, there is still a preponderance of Mackays in the D\u00f9thaich.\nMuch of the population of approximately 13,000 inhabitants are situated in small coastal towns, such as Helmsdale and Lochinver, which until very recently made much of their living from the rich fishing of the waters around the British Isles. Much of Sutherland is poor relative to the rest of the UK, with few job opportunities beyond government-funded employment, agriculture and seasonal tourism. Further education is provided by North Highland College, part of the University of the Highlands and Islands. The Ross House Campus in Dornoch was the first establishment in the United Kingdom to provide a degree in golf management. The Burghfield House Campus, also in Dornoch, is the home for the Centre for History teaching undergraduate and postgraduate history degrees to students around the UHI network and worldwide.\n\n", "actual": "1", "rationale": "The statement \"historic county(Bonar Bridge, Sutherland)\" is true because Bonar Bridge is located in the historic county of Sutherland.", "predicted": "1"}, {"predicate": "historic county", "arguments": "Coigach, Cromartyshire", "world": "historic county: traditional, geographical division of Great Britain and Ireland.Coigach: Coigach (Scottish Gaelic: A' Ch\u00f2igeach) is a peninsula north of Ullapool, in Wester Ross in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland.

The highest summit is Ben Mor Coigach at 743 metres; the distinctive profile of Stac Pollaidh is the other main peak within Coigach.

The present county was formed under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, which came into effect in 1996, and comprises some sixty percent of the historic county. Between 1974 and 1996, the county was known by the ancient title of Gwent, recalling the medieval Welsh kingdom.

It is recognised by Cornish and Celtic political groups as one of the Celtic nations, and is the homeland of the Cornish people. The county is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, Devon to the east, and the English Channel to the south. The largest settlement is Falmouth, and the county town is the city of Truro.\nThe county is rural, with an area of 1,375 square miles (3,562 km2) and population of 568,210. After Falmouth (23,061), the largest settlements are Penzance, Newquay, St Austell, and Truro. For local government purposes most of Cornwall is a unitary authority area, with the Isles of Scilly having a unique local authority. The Cornish nationalist movement disputes the constitutional status of Cornwall and seeks greater autonomy within the United Kingdom.\nCornwall is the westernmost part of the South West Peninsula. Its coastline is characterised by steep cliffs and, to the south, several rias, including those at the mouths of the rivers Fal and Fowey. It includes the southernmost point on Great Britain, Lizard Point, and forms a large part of the Cornwall National Landscape. The national landscape also includes Bodmin Moor, an upland outcrop of the Cornubian batholith granite formation. The county contains many short rivers; the longest is the Tamar, which forms the border with Devon.\nCornwall had a minor Roman presence, and later formed part of the Brittonic kingdom of Dumnonia. From the 7th century, the Britons in the South West increasingly came into conflict with the expanding Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, eventually being pushed west of the Tamar; by the Norman Conquest Cornwall was administered as part of England, though it retained its own culture. The remainder of the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period were relatively settled, with Cornwall developing its tin mining industry and becoming a duchy in 1337. During the Industrial Revolution, the tin and copper mines were expanded and then declined, with china clay extraction becoming a major industry. Railways were built, leading to a growth of tourism in the 20th century.

Shetland Islands: Shetland, also called the Shetland Islands, is an archipelago in Scotland lying between Orkney, the Faroe Islands, and Norway. It is the northernmost region of the United Kingdom.\nThe islands lie about 80 km (50 mi) to the northeast of Orkney, 170 km (110 mi) from mainland Scotland and 220 km (140 mi) west of Norway. They form part of the border between the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the North Sea to the east. Their total area is 1,466 km2 (566 sq mi), and the population totalled 22,920 in 2019. The islands comprise the Shetland constituency of the Scottish Parliament. The local authority, the Shetland Islands Council, is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. The islands' administrative centre, largest settlement and only burgh is Lerwick, which has been the capital of Shetland since 1708, before which time the capital was Scalloway.\nThe archipelago has an oceanic climate, complex geology, rugged coastline, and many low, rolling hills.\nThe largest island, known as \"the Mainland\", has an area of 967 km2 (373 sq mi), and is the fifth-largest island in the British Isles.

Picts are known to have been the original inhabitants of the islands, before the Norse conquest and subsequent colonisation in the Early Middle Ages. During the 10th to 15th centuries, the islands formed part of the Kingdom of Norway until they were annexed into the Kingdom of Scotland due to a royal dispute involving the payment of a dowry. In 1707, when Scotland and England united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, trade between Shetland and continental Northern Europe decreased. The discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s significantly boosted Shetland's economy, employment and public-sector revenues.

Almost all place names in the islands have Norse origin. The islands have produced a variety of prose writers and poets, who have often written in the distinctive Shetland dialect. Numerous areas on the islands have been set aside to protect the local fauna and flora, including a number of important seabird nesting sites. The Shetland pony and Shetland Sheepdog are two well-known Shetland animal breeds. Other animals with local breeds include the Shetland sheep, cow, goose, and duck. The Shetland pig, or grice, has been extinct since about 1930.\nThe islands' motto, which appears on the Council's coat of arms, is \"Me\u00f0 l\u00f6gum skal land byggja\" (\"By law shall the land be built\").

The county has a shoreline on the Severn Estuary, which is crossed at this point by the Severn Bridge and Second Severn Crossing.\nThe name derives from the historic county of the same name, of which the contemporary county covers the eastern three-fifths. The present county was formed under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, which came into effect in 1996, and comprises some sixty percent of the historic county. Between 1974 and 1996, the county was known by the ancient title of Gwent, recalling the medieval Welsh kingdom.

The B801 at Richonich links the village of Kinlochbervie and associated crofting townships such as Oldshoremore to the A838. Sutherland: Sutherland (Scottish Gaelic: Cataibh) is a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area in the Highlands of Scotland. Its county town is Dornoch. Sutherland borders Caithness and Moray Firth to the east, Ross-shire and Cromartyshire (later combined into Ross and Cromarty) to the south and the Atlantic to the north and west. Like its southern neighbour Ross-shire, Sutherland has some of the most dramatic scenery in Europe, especially on its western fringe where the mountains meet the sea. These include high sea cliffs and very old mountains composed of Precambrian and Cambrian rocks.\nThe name Sutherland dates from the period of Norwegian Viking rule and settlement over much of the Highlands and Islands, under the rule of the jarl of Orkney. Although it contains some of the northernmost land in the island of Great Britain, it was called Su\u00f0rland (\"southern land\") from the standpoint of Orkney and Caithness. In Gaelic, the area is referred to according to its traditional areas: D\u00f9thaich MhicAoidh (or D\u00f9thaich 'IcAoidh) (MacAoidh's country) in the northeast, Asainte (Assynt) in the west, and Cataibh in the east. Cataibh is also sometimes used to refer to the area as a whole. The northeast corner of Sutherland, traditionally known as the Province of Strathnaver, was not incorporated into Sutherland until 1601. This was the home of the powerful and warlike Clan Mackay, and as such was named in Gaelic, D\u00f9thaich 'Ic Aoidh, the Homeland of Mackay. Even today this part of Sutherland is known as Mackay Country, and, unlike other areas of Scotland where the names traditionally associated with the area have become diluted, there is still a preponderance of Mackays in the D\u00f9thaich.\nMuch of the population of approximately 13,000 inhabitants are situated in small coastal towns, such as Helmsdale and Lochinver, which until very recently made much of their living from the rich fishing of the waters around the British Isles. Much of Sutherland is poor relative to the rest of the UK, with few job opportunities beyond government-funded employment, agriculture and seasonal tourism. Further education is provided by North Highland College, part of the University of the Highlands and Islands. The Ross House Campus in Dornoch was the first establishment in the United Kingdom to provide a degree in golf management. The Burghfield House Campus, also in Dornoch, is the home for the Centre for History teaching undergraduate and postgraduate history degrees to students around the UHI network and worldwide.\n\n", "actual": "1", "rationale": "The statement \"historic county(Rhiconich, Sutherland)\" is true because Rhiconich is located in the historic county of Sutherland.", "predicted": "1"}, {"predicate": "historic county", "arguments": "Naas General Hospital, County Kildare", "world": "historic county: traditional, geographical division of Great Britain and Ireland.Naas General Hospital: Naas General Hospital (Irish: Ospid\u00e9al Ginear\u00e1lta an N\u00e1is) is a general hospital located on the Craddockstown Road at Naas in County Kildare in Ireland.

The north and east of the county are more sparsely populated, however the north east includes the southern part of the Teesside conurbation, and the port city of Kingston upon Hull is located in the south-east. York is located near the centre of the county. Yorkshire has a coastline to the North Sea to the east. The North York Moors occupy the north east of the county, and the centre contains the Vale of Mowbray in the north and the Vale of York in the south. The west contains part of the Pennines, which form the Yorkshire Dales in the north-west.\nThe historic county was bordered by County Durham to the north, the North Sea to the east, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Cheshire to the south, and Lancashire and Westmorland to the west. It was the largest by area in the United Kingdom. From the Middle Ages the county was subdivided into smaller administrative areas; the city of York was a self-governing county corporate from 1396, and the rest of the county was divided into three ridings \u2013 North, East, and West. From 1660 onwards each riding had its own lord-lieutenant, and between 1889 and 1974 the ridings were administrative counties. There was a Sheriff of Yorkshire until 1974. Yorkshire gives its name to four modern ceremonial counties: East Riding of Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, and West Yorkshire, which together cover most of the historic county.Yorkshire Day is observed annually on 1 August and is a celebration of the general culture of Yorkshire, including its history and dialect. Its name is used by several institutions, for example the Royal Yorkshire Regiment of the British Army, in sport, and in the media.

The national landscape also includes Bodmin Moor, an upland outcrop of the Cornubian batholith granite formation. The county contains many short rivers; the longest is the Tamar, which forms the border with Devon.\nCornwall had a minor Roman presence, and later formed part of the Brittonic kingdom of Dumnonia. From the 7th century, the Britons in the South West increasingly came into conflict with the expanding Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, eventually being pushed west of the Tamar; by the Norman Conquest Cornwall was administered as part of England, though it retained its own culture. The remainder of the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period were relatively settled, with Cornwall developing its tin mining industry and becoming a duchy in 1337. During the Industrial Revolution, the tin and copper mines were expanded and then declined, with china clay extraction becoming a major industry.

It was known locally as the Danes' Road. It was constructed from oak planks in 148\u2013147 BC, making it contemporary with the Siege of Carthage.\nThe trackway is situated in an area which is the site of industrial-scale mechanised peat harvesting by the Bord na M\u00f3na, principally to supply the peat-fired power stations of the Electricity Supply Board. While today a generally flat and open landscape, in the Iron Age it was covered by bog, quicksand, and ponds, surround by dense woodlands of birch, willow, hazel and alder while higher ground was covered by oak and ash. The terrain was dangerous and impassible for much of the year.\nIn 1984, timbers recovered from Corlea were radiocarbon dated to the Iron Age, rather than the Bronze Age as had been expected, and an archaeological project was established under the leadership of Professor Barry Raftery to investigate the site before it was destroyed by peat-digging. Excavations to 1991 in Corlea bog revealed 59 toghers in an area of around 125 hectares and further work has raised the total to 108 with a further 76 in the nearby Derryoghil bog.\nThe majority of these toghers are constructed from woven hurdles laid on heaped brushwood on top of the surface, built to be used by people on foot. Four, including Corlea 1, the Corlea Trackway proper, are corduroy roads, built from split planks laid on top of raised rails and suitable for wheeled traffic. The Corlea Trackway is made from oak planks 3 to 3.5 metres (9.8 to 11.5 ft) long and around 15 cm (5.9 in) thick laid on rails around 1.2 metres (3 ft 11 in) apart. The road was at least 1 km (0.62 mi) long. Dendrochronological study suggests that the timber used in construction was felled in late 148 BC or early in 147 BC and the road built then. Raftery estimated that the sleepers alone amount to a 300 large oak trees, or a thousand wagon-loads, with a similar volume of birch for the rails. The Corlea Trackway ended on a small island, from which a second trackway, excavated in 1957 and since radiocarbon dated also to 148 BC, again around 1 kilometre long, connected to dry land on the far side of the bog. The construction of the roadway required a great deal of labour, comparable to that used in the construction of ritual monuments such as barrows.\nThe purpose of the Corlea Trackway is uncertain. For the smaller toghers, O'Sullivan remarks that \"there is a growing sense that these were not structures designed to cross the bog, but to get into the bog\". Massive structures such as the Corlea Trackway may also have served to get into the bog, perhaps for ritual purposes, rather than merely to cross it. Whatever its purpose, the roadway was usable for only a few years. Gradually covered by the rising bog and sinking under its own weight, it was covered by the bog within a decade, and perhaps less, where it remained preserved for two millennia.The Corlea Trackway, seemingly constructed in a single year, has suggested comparisons with the Irish language tale Tochmarc \u00c9ta\u00edne (The Wooing of \u00c9ta\u00edn), where King Eochu Airem sets Midir tasks such as planting a forest and building a road across a bog where none had ever been before at a place called M\u00f3in L\u00e1mraige.\n\n County Longford: County Longford (Irish: Contae an Longfoirt) is a county in Ireland.

Middlesex: Middlesex (; abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England. Its area was almost entirely within the wider urbanised area of London and mostly within the ceremonial county of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring ceremonial counties. The county's boundaries largely followed three rivers: the Thames in the south, the Lea to the east and the Colne to the west. A line of hills formed the northern boundary with Hertfordshire.\nMiddlesex county's name derives from its origin as the Middle Saxon Province of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Essex, with the county of Middlesex subsequently formed from part of that territory in either the ninth or tenth century, and remaining an administrative unit until 1965. The county was the second smallest of the historic counties of England, after Rutland.\nThe City of London became a county corporate in the 12th century; this gave it self-governance, and it was also able to exert political control over the rest of Middlesex as the Sheriffs of London were given jurisdiction in Middlesex, though the county otherwise remained separate. To the east of the City, the Tower Division (or Tower Hamlets) had considerable autonomy under its own Lord Lieutenant.  To the west, precincts around Westminster and Charing Cross became built up.\nAs built up areas of London expanded into rural Middlesex, even given the London Sheriffs' jurisdiction, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to expand the City of London boundaries into the county, posing problems for the administration of local government, public infrastructure, and justice. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population density was especially high in the southeast of the county, including the East and West Ends of London. In 1855, in response to some of these challenges the densely populated southeast, together with sections of Kent and Surrey, came under the Metropolitan Board of Works for certain infrastructure purposes, while remaining a part of Middlesex, and the Metropolitan Police also developed in the 19th century.\nWhen county councils were introduced in 1889, about 20% of the area of the historic county, along with a third of its population, was incorporated into the new administrative County of London, with the rest forming the administrative county of Middlesex, governed by the Middlesex County Council that met regularly at the Middlesex Guildhall in Westminster.

It includes the ceremonial counties of East Sussex and West Sussex. \nThe kingdom of Sussex emerged in the 5th century from the Roman canton of the Regni and the Iron Age tribal region that preceded it. In about 827, shortly after the Battle of Ellendun, Sussex was conquered by Wessex. From 860 it was ruled by the kings of Wessex and by 927 it was joined by the remaining Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to form the kingdom of England. By the Norman period Sussex was subdivided into administrative districts known as rapes, which were themselves divided into hundreds. By the sixteenth century the eastern three rapes and the western three rapes were combined for most of the meetings of the court of quarter sessions. This arrangement was maintained when administrative counties and independent county boroughs were established in 1889. In Sussex this led to the creation of East Sussex County Council and West Sussex County Council to govern smaller towns and rural areas, while the larger towns were made county boroughs independent of the county councils. \nThe basic division of Sussex into east and west for the purposes of administration continued in subsequent local government reform. The Lord Lieutenant and Sheriff of Sussex were replaced in 1974 with separate posts for East and West Sussex, with Sussex losing its status as a ceremonial county.\nSussex is bordered by Surrey to the north, Kent to the north-east, the English Channel to the south, and Hampshire to the west.

The historical and administrative heart of Hackney is Mare Street, which lies 5 miles (8 km) north-east of Charing Cross. The borough is named after Hackney, its principal district. Southern and eastern parts of the borough are popularly regarded as being part of east London that spans some of the traditional East End of London with the northwest belonging to north London. Its population is estimated to be 281,120.\nThe London Plan issued by the Greater London Authority assigns whole boroughs to sub-regions for statutory monitoring, engagement and resource allocation purposes. The most recent (2011) iteration of this plan assigns Hackney to the 'East' sub-region, while the 2008 and 2004 versions assigned the borough to \"North\" and \"East\" sub-regions respectively. The modern borough was formed in 1965 by the merger of the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney with the much smaller Metropolitan Boroughs of Stoke Newington and Shoreditch.\nHackney is bounded by Islington to the west, Haringey to the north, Waltham Forest to the north-east, Newham to the east, Tower Hamlets to the south-east and the City of London to the south-west. Hackney was one of the host boroughs of the London Olympics in 2012, with several of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park venues falling within its boundaries. Middlesex: Middlesex (; abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England. Its area was almost entirely within the wider urbanised area of London and mostly within the ceremonial county of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring ceremonial counties. The county's boundaries largely followed three rivers: the Thames in the south, the Lea to the east and the Colne to the west. A line of hills formed the northern boundary with Hertfordshire.\nMiddlesex county's name derives from its origin as the Middle Saxon Province of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Essex, with the county of Middlesex subsequently formed from part of that territory in either the ninth or tenth century, and remaining an administrative unit until 1965. The county was the second smallest of the historic counties of England, after Rutland.\nThe City of London became a county corporate in the 12th century; this gave it self-governance, and it was also able to exert political control over the rest of Middlesex as the Sheriffs of London were given jurisdiction in Middlesex, though the county otherwise remained separate. To the east of the City, the Tower Division (or Tower Hamlets) had considerable autonomy under its own Lord Lieutenant.  To the west, precincts around Westminster and Charing Cross became built up.\nAs built up areas of London expanded into rural Middlesex, even given the London Sheriffs' jurisdiction, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to expand the City of London boundaries into the county, posing problems for the administration of local government, public infrastructure, and justice. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population density was especially high in the southeast of the county, including the East and West Ends of London. In 1855, in response to some of these challenges the densely populated southeast, together with sections of Kent and Surrey, came under the Metropolitan Board of Works for certain infrastructure purposes, while remaining a part of Middlesex, and the Metropolitan Police also developed in the 19th century.\nWhen county councils were introduced in 1889, about 20% of the area of the historic county, along with a third of its population, was incorporated into the new administrative County of London, with the rest forming the administrative county of Middlesex, governed by the Middlesex County Council that met regularly at the Middlesex Guildhall in Westminster.

Dublin city is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Ireland, as well as the largest city on the island of Ireland. Roughly 9 out of every 10 people in County Dublin lives within Dublin city and its suburbs. Several sizeable towns that are considered separate from the city, such as Rush, Donabate and Balbriggan, are located in the far north of the county. Swords, while separated from the city by a green belt around Dublin Airport, is considered a suburban commuter town and an emerging small city.The third smallest county by land area, Dublin is bordered by Meath to the west and north, Kildare to the west, Wicklow to the south and the Irish Sea to the east. The southern part of the county is dominated by the Dublin Mountains, which rise to around 760 metres (2,500 ft) and contain numerous valleys, reservoirs and forests. The county's east coast is punctuated by several bays and inlets, including Rogerstown Estuary, Broadmeadow Estuary, Baldoyle Bay and most prominently, Dublin Bay. The northern section of the county, today known as Fingal, varies enormously in character, from densely populated suburban towns of the city's commuter belt to flat, fertile plains, which are some of the country's largest horticultural and agricultural hubs.\nDublin is the oldest county in Ireland, and was the first part of the island to be shired following the Norman invasion in the late 1100s.

Portslade Village, the original settlement a mile inland to the north, was built up in the 16th century. The arrival of the railway from Brighton in 1840 encouraged rapid development of the coastal area and in 1898 the southern part, formerly known as Copperas Gap, was granted urban district status and renamed Portslade-by-Sea, making it distinct from Portslade Village. After World War II the district of Mile Oak to the north was added. Today, Portslade is bisected from east to west by the old A27 road (now the A270) between Brighton and Worthing, each part having a distinct character. Sussex: Sussex (/\u02c8s\u028cs\u026aks/; from the Old English S\u016b\u00fes\u0113axe; lit.\u2009'South Saxons') is an area and cultural region within South East England which was historically a kingdom and later a county. It includes the ceremonial counties of East Sussex and West Sussex. \nThe kingdom of Sussex emerged in the 5th century from the Roman canton of the Regni and the Iron Age tribal region that preceded it. In about 827, shortly after the Battle of Ellendun, Sussex was conquered by Wessex. From 860 it was ruled by the kings of Wessex and by 927 it was joined by the remaining Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to form the kingdom of England. By the Norman period Sussex was subdivided into administrative districts known as rapes, which were themselves divided into hundreds. By the sixteenth century the eastern three rapes and the western three rapes were combined for most of the meetings of the court of quarter sessions. This arrangement was maintained when administrative counties and independent county boroughs were established in 1889. In Sussex this led to the creation of East Sussex County Council and West Sussex County Council to govern smaller towns and rural areas, while the larger towns were made county boroughs independent of the county councils. \nThe basic division of Sussex into east and west for the purposes of administration continued in subsequent local government reform. The Lord Lieutenant and Sheriff of Sussex were replaced in 1974 with separate posts for East and West Sussex, with Sussex losing its status as a ceremonial county.\nSussex is bordered by Surrey to the north, Kent to the north-east, the English Channel to the south, and Hampshire to the west. Two-thirds of the population live along its 220 kilometres (137 mi) of coastline or in the Brighton-Gatwick corridor. This includes the city of Brighton and Hove and its wider city region. The rest of the area is sparsely populated and includes large parts of the South Downs National Park and the National Landscapes of the High Weald and Chichester Harbour.\nSussex is recognised as a single cultural region, significant in culture and sport and is used by a range of organisations as a regional unit.

Sheriffs were seldom appointed, and further acts of 1649 and 1661 restated its separation from Inverness.

It was the largest by area in the United Kingdom. From the Middle Ages the county was subdivided into smaller administrative areas; the city of York was a self-governing county corporate from 1396, and the rest of the county was divided into three ridings \u2013 North, East, and West. From 1660 onwards each riding had its own lord-lieutenant, and between 1889 and 1974 the ridings were administrative counties. There was a Sheriff of Yorkshire until 1974.

Orkney is 10 miles (16 km) north of the coast of Caithness and has about 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited.

The local council is Orkney Islands Council, one of only three councils in Scotland with a majority of elected members who are independents.The islands have been inhabited for at least 8,500 years, originally occupied by Mesolithic and Neolithic tribes and then by the Picts. Orkney was colonised and later annexed by the Kingdom of Norway in 875 and settled by the Norsemen. In 1472, the Parliament of Scotland absorbed the Earldom of Orkney into the Kingdom of Scotland, following failure to pay a dowry promised to James III of Scotland by the family of his bride, Margaret of Denmark.In addition to the Mainland, most of the remaining islands are divided into two groups: the North Isles and the South Isles. The local climate is relatively mild and the soils are extremely fertile; most of the land is farmed, and agriculture is the most important sector of the economy. The significant wind and marine energy resources are of growing importance; the amount of electricity that Orkney generates annually from renewable energy sources exceeds its demand. Daytime temperatures generally range between 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F) in winter and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in summer.\nThe local people are known as Orcadians; they speak a distinctive dialect of the Scots language and have a rich body of folklore.

Middlesex: Middlesex (; abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England. Its area was almost entirely within the wider urbanised area of London and mostly within the ceremonial county of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring ceremonial counties. The county's boundaries largely followed three rivers: the Thames in the south, the Lea to the east and the Colne to the west. A line of hills formed the northern boundary with Hertfordshire.\nMiddlesex county's name derives from its origin as the Middle Saxon Province of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Essex, with the county of Middlesex subsequently formed from part of that territory in either the ninth or tenth century, and remaining an administrative unit until 1965. The county was the second smallest of the historic counties of England, after Rutland.\nThe City of London became a county corporate in the 12th century; this gave it self-governance, and it was also able to exert political control over the rest of Middlesex as the Sheriffs of London were given jurisdiction in Middlesex, though the county otherwise remained separate. To the east of the City, the Tower Division (or Tower Hamlets) had considerable autonomy under its own Lord Lieutenant.  To the west, precincts around Westminster and Charing Cross became built up.\nAs built up areas of London expanded into rural Middlesex, even given the London Sheriffs' jurisdiction, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to expand the City of London boundaries into the county, posing problems for the administration of local government, public infrastructure, and justice. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population density was especially high in the southeast of the county, including the East and West Ends of London. In 1855, in response to some of these challenges the densely populated southeast, together with sections of Kent and Surrey, came under the Metropolitan Board of Works for certain infrastructure purposes, while remaining a part of Middlesex, and the Metropolitan Police also developed in the 19th century.\nWhen county councils were introduced in 1889, about 20% of the area of the historic county, along with a third of its population, was incorporated into the new administrative County of London, with the rest forming the administrative county of Middlesex, governed by the Middlesex County Council that met regularly at the Middlesex Guildhall in Westminster.

Most of the historic county's territory is within the modern council area of Argyll and Bute, with the main differences being that the Morvern and Ardnamurchan areas from the historic county are now in the Highland council area, whilst the Isle of Bute and the Helensburgh area were not in historic Argyll but are now in the Argyll and Bute council area.\nThere was an Argyllshire constituency of the Parliament of Great Britain then Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1708 until 1983.", "actual": "1", "rationale": "The statement \"historic county(Toward, Argyll)\" is true if Toward is located within the historic county of Argyll.", "predicted": "1"}, {"predicate": "historic county", "arguments": "The Gwineas, Cornwall", "world": "historic county: traditional, geographical division of Great Britain and Ireland.The Gwineas: The Gwineas, also known as The Gwinges, are a set of approximately fifteen rocks in the extreme southern English Channel, off the coast of the fishing village of Gorran Haven, Cornwall, on the south-west coast of Great Britain, remarkable for its seals, dolphins, gannets, and cormorants.
