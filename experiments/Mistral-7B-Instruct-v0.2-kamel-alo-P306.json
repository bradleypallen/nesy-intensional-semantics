The condition is \"operating system is Unix-like,\" and the consequence is \"operating system is ProFTPD.\"\n\nTo evaluate the truth value of this statement, we need to determine if the condition is true or false, and if it's true, then we need to determine if the consequence is also true.\n\nFirst, let's consider the condition. \"Unix-like operating system\" refers to an operating system that is similar in design and functionality to the original Unix operating system. Examples of Unix-like operating systems include Linux, macOS, and BSD.\n\nNow, let's consider the consequence. ProFTPD is a free and open-source FTP server software that can be installed and run on various operating systems, including Unix-like systems.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the statement \"operating system(ProFTPD, Unix-like operating system)\" is true.\n\n{answer}\n1", "predicted": ""}, {"predicate": "operating system", "arguments": "Cabri Geometry, Microsoft Windows", "world": "operating system: operating system (OS) on which a software works or the OS installed on hardware.", "actual": "1", "rationale": "###\n{rationale}\nThe statement \"operating system(Cabri Geometry, Microsoft Windows)\" is a compound statement made up of two simpler statements: \"operating system(Cabri Geometry)\" and \"operating system(Microsoft Windows)\". To evaluate the truth value of this compound statement, we need to determine the truth values of each of its simpler components and then apply the rules of logical combination.\nThe first simpler statement, \"operating system(Cabri Geometry)\", is true if the Cabri Geometry software works on some operating system. Cabri Geometry is a mathematical software application, and it can run on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Therefore, the statement \"operating system(Cabri Geometry)\" is true.\nThe second simpler statement, \"operating system(Microsoft Windows)\", is true if Microsoft Windows is an operating system. Microsoft Windows is indeed an operating system, so the statement \"operating system(Microsoft Windows)\" is also true.\nSince both simpler statements are true, we can apply the logical conjunction rule to combine them and determine the truth value of the compound statement. The logical conjunction of two statements, A and B, is true if and only if both A and B are true.
